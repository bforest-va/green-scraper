The majority of existing buildings today (the largest end-user of energy) were built more than 20 years ago with thermally inefficient windows, responsible for up to 40% of building energy loss. In the U.S. alone, replacing the 7Bn sq. ft. of inefficient windows in commercial buildings with high-performance glass can reduce energy consumption by about 700 trillion BTUs, lowering CO2 emissions by 1.7 gigatons and providing $260Bn in savings annually. The problem is that replacing the windows is almost always not a feasible option for building owners due to the associated high costs, business disruption, and very long payback periods.
INOVUES developed an innovative solution that reduces the cost of upgrading the windows and glass facades of commercial buildings by up to 10 times while also enabling them to incorporate the latest energy-saving and smart glass technologies without replacement or reglazing. We make it feasible – and financially attractive – for building owners to upgrade their windows to save up to 40% on energy consumption while improving occupant comfort and increasing the value and sustainability of their properties—all at a fraction of the cost of window replacement and without disruption or upfront costs. Our mission is to help cities worldwide achieve their energy-efficiency and emissions-reduction targets by increasing and accelerating the rate of window upgrades.
Our product is currently installed on buildings in Boston, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Our early adopters include Fortune 500, large commercial real estate companies, and an alliance of 140+ energy utilities. We are backed by great investors, including Saint-Gobain, one of the world’s largest building products companies, and CTAN, the largest angel investor group in the US.
INOVUES was recently featured by Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy in their 2021 Climate Action Playbook. In 2019, INOVUES was named to Cleantech Group's 50-to-Watch List, which recognizes the top 50 early-stage companies globally that are delivering high-impact solutions that can change the future of sustainability.

Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter the ocean. A significant percentage of this plastic drifts into large systems of circulating ocean currents, also known as gyres. Once trapped in a gyre, the plastic will break down into microplastics and become increasingly easier to mistake for food by sea life.Going after it with vessels and nets would be costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive and lead to vast amounts of carbon emission and by-catch. That is why The Ocean Cleanup is developing a passive system, moving with the currents  just like the plastic  to catch it. The system consists of a 600-meter-long floater that sits at the surface of the water and a tapered 3-meter-deep skirt attached below. The floater provides buoyancy to the system and prevents plastic from flowing over it, while the skirt stops debris from escaping underneath. As the system moves through the water, the plastic continues to collect within the boundaries of the U-shaped system.By deploying a fleet of systems, The Ocean Cleanup has estimated to be able to remove 50% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in just 5 years' time. The concentrated plastic will be brought back to shore for recycling and sold to B2C companies. The revenue gained will help fund the cleanup expansion to the other four ocean gyres.In preparation for full-scale deployment, The Ocean Cleanup organized several expeditions to map the plastic pollution problem in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to an unprecedented degree of detail. The team simultaneously advanced its design through a series of scale model tests, including prototypes deployed in the North Sea 2016, 2017 and 2018.

Although we didn’t get all the forest saved, 7500 acres including several large virgin groves were eventually acquired and can be visited today. Our efforts helped galvanize the broad-based public awareness and outcry that led to this and many other forest victories across the state.


For almost 30 years we have been rallying Californians in defense of the state’s 17 million acres of woodland ecosystems and watersheds. We accomplish this through year-round education, grassroots organizing, litigation, work in elections, and executive-branch and legislative advocacy.

In 2016 several of Forests Forever's proudest accomplishments centered on the protection of California's fast-disappearing oak woodlands.

For the roughly seven million acres of oak woodlands in the state, the vast majority are on private land, enjoy scanty or no protection, and are rapidly being bulldozed to make way for housing developments, vineyards, highways and shopping malls.

In Mendocino County we played a key role in qualifying, then promoting, a voter initiative that effectively would ban the large-scale tree-poisoning method known as “hack and squirt.” On June 7 it passed on a solid 62 percent majority!

We also helped to qualify a ballot measure in Napa County—the Water, Forest, and Oak Woodland Protection Initiative. It would establish no-cut stream buffers while limiting the destruction of oak woodlands.

We were among the founding members of a new coalition in 2016, the California Oaks Coalition.

And in the City of Richmond, we helped to qualify and then to win a citizens initiative that protected some 430 acres of oak forest and savanna threatened with development adjacent to Wildcat Canyon Regional Park.


In 2014 and 2015 Forests Forever spent a great deal of effort playing a leading role in what has become a momentous struggle to fully realize what is our latest—and could be our last—great opportunity to thoroughly overhaul California’s broken system that regulates logging practices.

With letters and calls from our many supporters, coupled with the relentless pressure of our policy advocate, state officials began to listen and after years of advocacy work, legislation, and grassroots organizing California's first forestry-reform pilot project got underway in December 2016. “Cumulative watershed effects” assessment has been a fundamental requirement of the state’s forestry laws, but honored only in the breach for some 40 years. Now with the pilot project finally begun there's much reason to look for a positive outcome.

For one thing, Forests Forever's forest policy advocate Richard Gienger has been selected as one of the 21-person Pilot Project Working Group that will oversee the project it should wrap up in about two years.

These are a few of the more-recent examples of Forests Forever’s advocacy work, at all levels of government, as well as in the public-education arena."

Food production is the single greatest impact humans have on the environment. From mountains of food waste, to habitat destruction to clear land to grow animal feed for factory farms, to soil depletion leaving future harvests at risk: the food system needs to change.

Founded in 2013, we combine hard-hitting investigative research, mass public participation feasts,  and on the ground pilots for a better food system. As a result, we’ve put food issues, in particular waste, at the very top of the business and policy agendas. Read more about our impact.

A MORE SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEM?
Our food system is dysfunctional: using too many limited natural resources, and producing too much waste and pollution. But we believe we can secure nutritious and delicious food for everyone, without trashing our planet. Read about our model for a sustainable food system.

We work across multiple aspects of our food system, including industrial meat, food waste, farmed fish, British sugar and ‘green’ energy generated through Anaerobic Digestion of edible food.

We also work on campaigns around food citizenship, food commons and new food economies, piloting alternatives to the globalised, financialised food system.

Find out more about our programmes of work. You can also read our 2017-18 report here.

HOW WE WORK
To move towards a food system that nourishes both people and our planet will require significant changes to our food culture, the food economy and its governance. We are seeking to bring about these changes through a unique combination of campaigning and advocacy, citizen engagement and pilot programmes.

We expose systemic problems that have led to unsustainable use of resources within the food system. We act as a critical friend to industry and policy makers or, when more appropriate, we launch creative campaigns to achieve the changes that we seek (for example our campaigns Total Bull and our supermarket food waste scorecard).

We build coalitions with other civil society groups, mobilising activists around our agenda. Free public feasts are a key way in which we support the growth of diverse movements of citizens on food issues. We also use volunteering as a further opportunity for the public to ‘be the change’ and have a comprehensive youth engagement and food system education programme. We are proud of our ability to reach people from all walks of life, including those for whom engagement with our work is their first foray into environmental and food system activism, for example through our Gleaning Network.

When solutions cannot be achieved with changes to current organisations, models and practices, we roll up our sleeves and pilot alternatives – be it through gleaning or anchoring new community food economies. Through these pilots, we demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a new food economy, and enable replication of our success around the globe through training, toolkits and engaging with citizens, civil society allies and change makers far and wide."

Good progress is being made in the energy and transport sectors with renewable energy rapidly expanding and vehicles being electrified. Cows generate more than 4% of the global greenhouse gas emissions through farting and burping, that is more than twice as much as the world's entire fleet of airplanes. The agricultural sector has made very little progress and has been a missing puzzle piece in the efforts to reduce global warming. Until now.What we doMany years of research from world leading universities proves that supplementing the seaweed Asparagopsis as 1% of the cow's daily feed intake, reduce up to 80% of the enteric methane emissions they produce. The seaweeds bioactive compounds trigger a process in the cow's digestive system that block the production of methane, this without affecting the cow's health. This seaweed has never been commercially produced before, and Volta is taking on the challenge of producing it at scale.

1661,Spectral,[],https://spectral.energy/about/,,,"Growing awareness around the impacts of climate change has propelled a rapid movement towards fully renewable, emissions-free energy supply. At this moment, most grid infrastructure can only support a limited amount (10-20%*) of renewable energy input while remaining stable, due to the fluctuating nature of renewable energy streams. Current market models are based on a largely supply-driven energy economy which lacks the flexibility needed to allow for higher penetration of renewables. New, intelligent ways of managing energy supply and demand, combined with innovative business models, are needed in order to effectively manage our transition towards a clean energy economy.Our long-term vision is to develop scalable solutions that will revolutionize the way we provide for all of our core resources, focusing on the key areas needed for leading a healthy and fruitful life: energy, water, sanitation, food, shelter, and resource recovery. As our global population expands, the demand for energy and natural resources increases with it, putting more pressure on our already stressed planetary boundaries. It is visible across the board  from marine life and aquifers, to oil supplies and rare earth metals  we are rapidly depleting these finite resources and polluting our environment at alarming rates. As global supply chains become increasingly volatile and centralized systems are further strained, the number of people without adequate resource provision will continue to grow. Solving all of the challenges we face around resource security is a highly ambitious and long-term mission. The most we can do is to contribute our full efforts to help overcome the obstacles we face on our journey towards a sustainable future.We believe that one of the most urgent issues is to solve the challenges for providing for our energy needs in a sustainable way. Not only is access to energy essential for high quality of life, but virtually everything is reliant on an input of energy. Our entire global socio-economic eco-system has been built upon a foundation of fossil fuels  everything from growing food to resource extraction and water purification. Leveraging the full potential of the nearly unlimited source of energy from the sun is the first step towards dealing with the rest of the systemic challenges we've encountered. That is why Spectral has chosen to begin with tackling the obstacles we face in transitioning the global energy sector towards 100% sustainable energy supply.Spectral is a spin-off of Metabolic, an action agency for sustainable development, based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Our team started working together in 2012, under Metabolic, where we applied our expertise in clean technologies to develop projects like De Ceuvel"

They capture and store carbon and are one of the most promising, large-scale, and cost-effective opportunities to combat climate change. Rainforests also sustain rainfalls, food supply, vital ecosystems, and livelihoods for over a billion people. Protecting them is not just a moral imperative, it is essential for a stable, prosperous, and sustainable future for us all. As the COVID-19 crisis highlights, we live in a fragile and interconnected world where sustainability cannot be taken for granted.
There is increasing recognition of the urgency of climate change. The Paris Agreement in 2015 committed governments to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. 760 major corporations have committed to climate neutrality, and over 40 countries have implemented some form of carbon pricing scheme.  After two decades of putting necessary, effective, high integrity standards and market mechanisms in place, The Emergent Forest Finance Accelerator (“Emergent”) has the historic opportunity to channel this momentum to solving the deforestation crisis.
Emergent helps safeguard the world’s tropical forests by building a global market for forest carbon credits. Countries generate these credits by reducing deforestation and tropical deforestation (called “REDD+”). For forest countries, Emergent provides a guaranteed source of demand by facilitating access to a range of high-volume buyers, backed by a purchase guarantee from donors, giving countries the certainty needed to make investments in forest protection and chart a new course. For buyers, Emergent provides access to the highest-quality REDD+ credits, enabling them to meet their climate neutrality goals.

By changing our environment and spreading awareness, we are hoping to make a global change.

We also hope to serve as a example for other companies by proving that focusing on social and environmental responsibility just as much as profit is a sustainable business model.

Everything we do as a company is dedicated to furthering our mission.

That mission is restoring Earth and fighting against the evils of deforestation. We are always striving to find new ways to revitalize and restore the environment. Ultimately, we are here to leave the world a better place than we found it, while inspiring others to do the same for an Earth of tomorrow that is greener and brighter for all.

Through focusing on planting trees around the world, we can fight deforestation and man-made climate change affecting us now--and for all future generations to come. Furthermore, by planting trees we can help to contribute to local economies and the people who live there in a responsible way.

By subscribing and becoming a member, you take a stand in the fight for a better, greener, more sustainable Earth.

and are ripe for disruption by software.  GreenLancer seeks to transform professional services delivery into a more transparent, unified, intelligent customer experience.


 COMPANY OVERVIEW
​
Through our experience providing professional design and permitting services, we realize that the “brick-and-mortar” system is broken and inefficient. Solar and Telecom installers face high project costs, slow turnaround times, and design bottlenecks. GreenLancer’s innovative platform provides a “plug-n-play” access point to the solar designs and permitting services that an internal resource or brick-and-mortar firm would normally provide. GreenLancer’s lean manufacturing approach has proven to reduces soft costs and streamlines the project development process.



Our inspiration for solving this problem comes from Henry Ford’s introduction of the assembly line over 100 years ago and the resulting disruption of the entire manufacturing industry. However, assembly line design isn’t limited to manufacturing. Every professional service utilized by solar energy developers and contractors has processes, which can be broken down and solved with the same systematic approach. GreenLancer.com harnesses a combination of the latest technologies with a distributed workforce to bring assembly lines into the 21st century resulting in the next generation of professional services.

The Nuclear Innovation Alliance (NIA) is a non-profit think tank working to enable nuclear power as a global solution to mitigate climate change. Through policy analysis, research, and education, we are catalyzing the next era of nuclear energy. Our organization is funded primarily through charitable grants and philanthropic donations from climate-concerned individuals and organizations.
Our Mission
Bring more economically competitive zero-carbon emission energy to the world by supporting entrepreneurialism and accelerated innovation and commercialization of advanced nuclear energy.
Our Team
Our team is passionate about clean energy and leaving the world better than we found it. We celebrate and value diversity and are committed to building an inclusive organization. We have backgrounds in technology, policy, law, and social sciences, and seek to combine our strengths with the input of other stakeholders and experts to make positive change.
Our Strategy
Nuclear energy is a technology and an expansive scientific field that after many years of limited advancements has tremendous potential today for innovation. A tradition of deep and extensive research into the development of nuclear energy is now combining with decades of progress from other technological fields in order to create new ventures and make up for decades of lost time. For nuclear innovation to thrive and serve global energy and environmental goals, both private and public investment in nuclear energy development and deployment must be robust. Those investments will only be made if three important criteria are met:

There is a clear pathway to a growing market that will attract private investment;
There is a credible case to earn public investment; and
There is public support for the use of nuclear power.

The NIA works towards fulfillment of these three criteria through:

technically-informed action research that features recommended policies, programs, and funding, as well as opportunities for innovation.
support of entrepreneurialism through the Nuclear Innovation Bootcamp.
improving discourse on nuclear energy through speaking, presentations, and direct engagement with diverse stakeholders.
providing educational information to policymakers, investors, and engaged members of the public.

Project Areas
The NIA’s main project areas directly support the strategy and are organized by the three criteria above.

Path to a Growing Market:

Development of clear, efficient, and effective regulatory processes through improvements to current practice
Development of strategies for international licensing harmonization to support rapid deployment at scale necessary to address climate change
Identification of challenges to nuclear energy use in emerging economies, to be followed by the development of strategies to address those challenges
Identification of nonproliferation challenges and opportunities associated with advanced reactors and recommendations for addressing them
Investor and customer education through provision of useful materials for learning more about the advanced nuclear industry and technology


Public Investment in Advanced Nuclear:

Development of sensible research, development, and demonstration policy that maximizes results without waste of taxpayer funds
Educational briefings and outreach to provide information on advanced nuclear energy
Regular testimony upon request


Public Support for the Use of Nuclear Power:

Providing unbiased, useful information about advanced nuclear on the NIA website and through speaking engagements
Technical support for organizations focused on public communication
Responses to media requests for information and input
Engagement with environmental and public interest organizations to seek common ground and common understanding

People feel like climate is an urgent problem but feel powerless to make a difference. We are empowering anyone to become a climate investor with as little as $5 so that everyone can benefit from the earnings of the energy transition. 
Climatize is an climate financial technology (FinTech) mobile application that sits uniquely at the crossroads of ClimateTech and the digitization of financial services by using crowdfunding to finance renewable energy projects. Climatize’s goal is to create the inclusive digital platform which can harness the collective financial power of the environmental movement by lowering the financial barrier for investment to just a few dollars, by giving investors full control of which projects their investments build and by providing a competitive return on investment. Climatize enables easy & automatic investments into loans for project developers constructing renewable energy projects. Investors receive a standardized, fixed rate, debt share in the project. Loan principal & interest are distributed back to the investors over the lifetime of the loan.
 
Why Climatize is the right solution
From the beginning Climatize is designed by the people, for the people. By creating an investment marketplace focused on the growing volume of the environmental movement we are leveraging the nature of the environmental movement and deploying an unaddressed tool to fight the climate crisis – the opportunity to incentivize collective action. The options you currently have to reduce your personal carbon footprint all require a varying degree of sacrifice such as eliminating meat from your diet or making a large investment to buy an electric vehicle or energy efficient appliances. For many people these options are either too hard or too expensive.
What Climatize is doing creates a new option; one which rewards you for the more environmental action you take. By bringing the minimum investment down to just a few cents, we are bringing impact investing within reach of everyone while creating a savings account that will save the world.
Climatize is opening an untapped source of finance for the renewable energy industry by focusing on including every financial level of impact investor."

4242,Seal the Seasons,[1-10],www.sealtheseasons.com,"Food & Agriculture, Food, Agriculture, & Land Use","Chapel Hill, NC, USA","Who we are:
Since 2000, more than 21 percent of small family farms have been forced to close. These farmers struggled to find a market for their fruit and year after year they were forced to leave some of their crop in the field. Eventually, it became too much and they had to close their doors.

Patrick Mateer met many struggling farmers while working at his local farmers market during his college years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Patrick also noticed an uptick in the demand for local food by consumers, who could only access it a couple weeks out of the year when a crop was in season.
​
Patrick founded Seal the Seasons in 2014 to connect the dots - making local frozen produce available year-round, while also helping provide small family farms with a reliable income stream year after year.

We work with family farmers on a state-by-state basis to freeze their produce in season and sell it in local grocery stores 365 days a year. We are on a mission to create a more localized food system and make local available in every aisle of the grocery store year-round.

Local matters:
Eating well means buying from local farmers and enjoying the best tasting produce all year long. Ideally, produce would be served on your table less than five days after being harvested.
​
The reality? Because of the way our current food system works, produce can often take more than a month on their journey from farm-to-table. These crops are chosen for hardiness and durability, which often means they are less nutritious and less tasty than those that are locally-grown.

​

Freezing locally-grown produce efficiently preserves the taste and nutrition of these perishable products, making it possible for local produce to be consistently available throughout the year. Our close relationships with local farmers allows us to source only the best produce, without worry about the need to survive lengthy transport.

Based in China, Canada and in the USA, our company will embrace the world’s low-carbon economy worth trillion dollars. This object complies with the trend of green, recycling development with low carbon emission. We are one of the ten finalists of NRG COSIA Carbon-Xprize (https://carbon.xprize.org/prizes/carbon/teams/c4x) and are currently preparing for the final competition at the ITC of Wyoming, USA with four other finalists from USA, Canada, UK and India.

 

Team C4X is dedicated to the research & development of CO2 utilization technology, including capture, conversion and utilization of industrial flue gas from thermal power plants, mining, cement, steel making, winery, etc. Our focus is the production of high-value basic chemical materials and new energy sources including ethylene carbonate (EC), ethylene glycol (EG), methanol etc. through chemical reactions with our novelty nano catalysts, and the production of supercritical CO2 foamed plastic products.

 

Carbon dioxide is very stable and usually decompose at temperature over 800℃ and under high pressure. Huge energy consumption makes it uneconomic to decompose. Our breakthrough technologies are able to convert CO2 into ethylene glycol and methanol in 120-180℃ at lower pressure with the help of Nano-catalysts. After more than 10 years of research and development, our team’s experts solved the problem of huge energy consumption in the carbon dioxide conversion! Comparing to the current methods of the synthesis of methanol and diol, the conversion and selectivity rates for methanol is 95-100%, ethylene glycol, up to 95-99%. Out nano-catalysts is economic and can be recycled after filter or centrifugal separation. The green and efficient process with low cost is conducive to industrial production."

Developed in cooperation with Argonne National Laboratory in 2010, this technology takes full advantage of graphene’s strength and elasticity to stabilize silicon in a composite anode. That is, CalBattery’s unique manufacturing process for SiGr anodes uniformly embeds nano-silicon into graphene platelets in stable structures that in turn absorb the silicon expansion during charging. This creates the most stable silicon anode material known today – effectively tripling anode specific capacity (from 325mAh/g to 1,250mAh/g) over the traditional graphite anode materials used today.

The CalBattery SiGr anode is now being commercialized as a superior “drop- in” replacement for graphite-based anode materials, offering significant benefits in Li-ion battery performance especially in energy density and specific capacity while reducing future Li-ion battery cost per kWhr by up to 70%."

4422,Echromic,[1-10],www.echromic.com,"Buildings & Cities, Materials & Manufacturing, Buildings","Boulder, CO, USA","e-Chromic Technologies is developing an innovative reflective electrochromic thin film that enables users to control light and solar heat transmission through windows.
Energy Efficient
Windows are the single greatest source of energy waste within most commercial and residential buildings. Our diffusely reflective electrochromic thin film will reduce air conditioner usage and related CO² emissions by ~35%. Unlike most other smart window technologies, our electrochromic window film is completely user controllable. On sunny warm weather days, it can be switched to reflective mode to significantly reduce solar heating through windows and dramatically reduce air conditioner usage.

During cold weather days, it can be switched to transparent mode, allowing solar heating to assist with interior warming, therefore reducing heating system usage. DOE energy models indicate that our reflective technology will deliver 43% greater energy savings than state of the art absorptive technologies at less than half the cost.

Retrofit
Dynamic window technologies on the market today turn dark when activated, causing them to absorb sunlight and convert it to heat. In order to isolate this “heating problem” (which can reach 60°C), providers must build their dynamic window surfaces into the interior of expensive new window units.

Our proprietary patented electrochromic thin film turns diffusely reflective when activated. This uniquely reflective technology does not suffer from the “heating problem” of the absorptive technologies. Therefore, our thin film can be used to retrofit installed windows. It can be applied from inside an office or home to existing windows, transforming them into highly energy efficient smart windows, cost effectively and with a minimum of occupant dislocation. Make your windows part of the ""internet of things.""

Market Size
The market for competing absorptive dynamic window technologies that requires purchase and installation of new windows is severely limited to new construction or major building rehab projects. The market opportunity for retrofit of existing installed windows is vastly larger. DOE estimates that there are 19.5 billion ft² of installed windows in the US alone. An estimated 536 million ft² are installed in commercial buildings in the US. Most of these buildings were constructed prior to implementation of ASHRAE standards in 1990. It is estimated that approximately 90% of installed windows in commercial buildings are not energy efficient. This results in an addressable market for

An estimated 536 million ft² are installed in commercial buildings in the US. Most of these buildings were constructed prior to implementation of ASHRAE standards in 1990. It is estimated that approximately 90% of installed windows in commercial buildings are not energy efficient. This results in an addressable market for retrofit that is measured in billions of dollars for the US alone. International market opportunities are even more attractive due to significantly higher costs for electricity.

Technology
Our proprietary reflective electrochromic technology was invented at the US Dept. of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden CO. We have an exclusive license with NREL to develop and commercialize this patented technology. Our electrochromic film will be wirelessly powered by the sun. It can be wirelessly controlled through an interface with a building management system, iOS or Android device.

Your windows join the Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Buildings and Smart Cities. Our reflective film can also be deposited onto flat glass and be built into new windows. Our reflective technology is well suited for automotive glass. It reduces solar heating on hot days and allows solar heating on cold days, thus increasing range between charges for electric vehicles."

Esoko started in 2005 as an experiment to see how the emergence of mobile technology in Africa, could improve the lives of rural communities across the continent. The first project enabled the delivery of market prices via SMS, in support of work that FoodNet was doing with MTN in Uganda. In addition, Esoko set up a call centre to support local languages and address issues with literacy.

Over time we realized farmers needed much more than price information, and added weather alerts, crop advice, and linking buyers with sellers. Various research finds such services can improve incomes for farmers by roughly 10%.

The company then leveraged its technical platform and field force for the collection of information, using tablet devices and smartphones. This technology, Insyt, became the backbone of many large scale social protection programs in Ghana – helping agencies convert from paper, thus reducing cost, time and errors in targeting beneficiaries.

Organizations all over Africa have used our technology to collect and disseminate different types of information on people and markets via smart phone, tablet, web, SMS and voice SMS.

The truth about chicken.

Like many of you, we were raised on chicken. It was a staple at our family meals, a standard in our school cafeterias, and a late-night go-to at our favorite fast food chains. It was cheap, tasty and omnipresent. And we never looked at it twice. Until we did. What we found was an industry mired in harsh realities of which far too many people are unaware. An industry that’s as unsustainable as it is unethical and unjust. Yet, even as that industry has proven destructive to our health, our feathered friends and our planet, it has enjoyed uninterrupted growth for decades.



 


We dared to ask.
What if we could make chicken better?

What if we could give people everything they love about chicken—the flavor, the texture, the experience—without the chicken? And what if we could take down “big chicken” in the process?





 


We dared to answer.
100% plant-based chicken that looks, cooks and tastes just like the animal-based counterpart.

Bravely made with a few simple, natural ingredients. Boldly healthy with high protein and low calories, and free of GMO, gluten and cholesterol. Brilliantly delicious with uncompromised flavor, texture and versatility. And better for people, chickens and our planet.





 


Small swap = Big impact.
What can a simple swap from chicken to daring do?

Turns out, quite a bit. For you, it means cooking, feeling and living a healthier life. For chickens, it means chipping away at the industry that kills over 9 billion each year for human consumption. And for the planet, it means moving towards a more sustainable food source that minimizes our ecological impact and carbon footprint. So be daring. Make the swap. And together we can dare to build a brighter future for ourselves and our planet.





 


daring is caring
Our ongoing initiative to improve every aspect of our business to be more sustainable and eco-friendly.

And to support like-minded organizations that are daring to build a brighter future for humankind and our planet.
 
We’re daring to make a difference. And we hope you’ll dare to join us.

MATERIALS DATA INFRASTRUCTURE
Data is the safest investment in materials and chemicals. It empowers your teams. It never goes out of date. It is an investment in knowledge forever. It forms the basis for analytics, visualization, and AI. The Citrine Platform stores and organizes your data in all of its complexityprocessing, structure, properties, performance, formulationmaking it available to materials and chemicals developers in the way they natively understand it and enabling AI-driven workflows.
MATERIALS-AWARE AI
Hierarchical relationships, rare data, and critical domain knowledge mean that traditional, naive AI approaches struggle with materials and chemicals. The AI engines within the Citrine Platform allow data scientists to build reusable, modular units, and connect them to each other to represent known relationships. The system then performs further analysis on its own to learn from your data. By coupling these together, the Citrine Platform AI system takes advantage of known theory, tacit knowledge, and empirical data to create models that are interpretable by the experts who use them. Best of all, modules can be reused again and again, so your data science expertise scales across an entire development organization.
SCIENTIFIC TOOLS AND WORKFLOWS
AI is not magic. It is an accelerant to your teams' existing practices, making them more efficient and effective. The Citrine Platform supports their workflows in each stage of the materials development process: ingesting new experimental data, analyzing it for new insights, and helping your teams decide what to do next. One such Citrine Platform powered workflow is Sequential learning, which supports your scientists with an AI-driven design of experiment that learns every step of the way, dramatically reducing the number of experiments and the length of time it takes to hit your product targets.

The Framework examines multiple drivers specific to each industry subsector, providing an ongoing evaluation of the impact on the loan book over the short (5 years), medium (10 years) and long (20 years) term. This bottoms-up approach considers the climate related financial risks across two distinct categories: Transition and Physical.
 
Transition risks
This identifies how a low-carbon policy and technological transition towards mitigating climate change could impact the credit risk in a bank’s loan book, as well as its lending strategy. Our modeling is based around four possible scenarios, ranging from a temperature rise of below 2°F to a more extreme situation of 4.3°F and above, mapping these to each subsector according to its carbon intensity. For example, oil, gas and transportation will experience profound, direct impact while the services and retail sectors will experience residual (but still significant) impact.
 
Physical Risks
Extreme, localized events such as floods, drought, hurricanes and winter freezes as well as chronic changes in climatic patterns such as rising temperatures, change in precipitation, increasing sea levels and desertification. Such events, along with accelerating change, pose risks in terms of individual incidents of damage and disruption or chronic shifts in labour, capital and other essential business drivers. Applying the ON Climate Assessment to your loan books enables you to understand the risks and potential impact of various climate change scenarios, enabling you to take a strategic view of your current loan books as well as shaping loan exposure to become more resilient."

We eat food laced with poison everyday. Even when we buy fresh produce marketed to us as organic, as most of us know, a fairly large percentage of that is not really organically grown. The increased occurrence of diseases such as cancer, is a direct result of this.
On the other hand, our farmers are in great distress. Dwindling incomes along with production, distribution and financing inefficiencies have made it impossible for Indian farmers to earn living wages predictably. As a result, they are resorting to using more and more chemicals to reduce their risk and stop their income from falling.
And finally, our top-soil, which has been amongst the best in the world, has been deteriorating rapidly and soil productivity has touched an all-time low. Earthworms and soil microbe populations are dwindling and we need more and more external harmful inputs every season to sustain the same production level as the earlier growing season.
This seems like a vicious cycle - and it worsens everyday.
Is there a solution ?
At Farmizen (www.farmizen.com), we believe we have a possible solution. The way it works is very simple -
a. You rent out a 600 square feet mini-farm located in a real farm near you for a monthly fee.
b. The farmer takes care of your vegetable crops for you.
c. You control your farm through an app available on Android and iOS - just like Farmville.
d. You can visit your farm anytime and harvest your own chemical-free produce.
e. If you are busy, Farmizen will home deliver your produce to you every week.

What is ESMC?
 

A non-profit organization bringing together a broad consortium of corporations, agricultural producer associations, NGOs and technology companies
The goal of ESMC is to launch a voluntary national ecosystem services market conceived and designed to sell ecosystem assets such as carbon and water quality and quantity credits for the agriculture sector by 2022.

What is distinct about ESMC?

Non-profit: We want to maximize environmental impact by delivering as much of the market value back to farmers and ranchers as possible and accelerate growth of the market.
Scientific rigor: We will ensure that our protocols have the strongest scientific basis possible to provide confidence and trust for both sellers and buyers of agricultural ecosystem assets.
Multiple markets: We are not a carbon credit-only initiative. Greenhouse gas impacts will be fundamental to our marketplace, but land stewardship practices can deliver other benefits like water quantity and quality improvements, enhancement of habitat, and protection of biodiversity.
Outcomes, not practices: Our protocols are focused strictly on measurement of outcomes on a farm or ranch. We do not require any specific practices or set of practices, to allow producers flexibility to manage their operations in a systematic way.

What is ESMC doing?

Developing protocols and a related technology platform for enrolling working agricultural lands and quantifying and verifying the assets they generate
Working with members and outside organizations to review and certify our protocols.
Funding research into key scientific and technological aspects of measuring actual environmental impacts of farmers’ and ranchers’ land stewardship practices.
Collaborating with ESMC members on a series of pilot projects in major agricultural production systems to test and refine our protocols and tools in the next 3 years.
ESMC’s research arm, the Ecosystem Services Market Research Consortium – or ESMRC – is working collaboratively to invest in identified research, development, demonstration, and economic gaps to overcome past and current market-based challenges.

Why? Healthy soils are paramount to the future of the agriculture industry, maintaining ecosystem function, and sustaining plant and animal communities. In addition to soil health, agricultural systems create critical ecological and natural resource impacts that benefit society, such as improved water quality, water use conservation, biodiversity, and pollinator and wildlife habitat. With approximately 70% of U.S. land in private ownership, America’s farmers and ranchers are key to creating solutions to address our nation’s soil health, natural resource, and ecosystem services challenges."

With that, a major collective statement against food waste was made, which was featured by over 85 media channels in 8 different countries!Since the beginning we understood that in order to curb food waste we would need much more than a smart and innovative solution; we would need a whole movement that supports our cause.

One such technique, Ocean Iron Fertilization (OIF), is based on a natural process that is one of the Earth's primary natural mechanisms to remove carbon dioxide. It has very high mitigation potential compared to other available methods, and also has relatively low cost.

OIF works by improving the efficiency of natural phytoplankton production in the open ocean, adding to the very large natural amount of carbon sequestration that takes place in the world's oceans every year. Publicly funded research scientists have investigated aspects of the science behind the technique in twelve small-scale experimental trials since 1993, which have shown that the addition of iron can stimulate large blooms of phytoplankton. Given this promise, a number of scientists and private corporations are calling for moderate scale demonstrations to better understand the efficacy and impact of this mechanism, specifically with the intention of assessing its possible use for climate mitigation"

Our parents would give us a few dollars. We'd eat whatever tasted good. And more often than not, if it was cheap and tasty, it was also accelerating chronic disease and climate change. That's how unjust our food system is.We think there are a couple reasons for this. First, the tools of our food system are limited. We're talking soy, corn, processed sugar, and animal protein. These are the core ingredients that the biggest food companies are using to make the food that is all around us. And it's not that these big companies don't care. In fact, they do care. It's hard to do anything different.And it's not just a limitation of tools, it's a mindset. The world does not believe it's possible to have healthier, sustainable food that is also affordable and delicious. That keeps anyone from even trying.We are trying to change that mindset. We started with this idea that we would build a food system that makes it really easy for people to eat well. How do you create a system like that? And could we get it done in our lifetime? How would that change things? And what would we need to do, day-to-day, as a company, to make that happen?It starts with the tools.We are proud to announce that as of August 2019 we have sold the equivalent of 10 million eggs  all made entirely from plants.Our plant-based JUST Egg uses 98% less water, emits 93% less CO2, and uses 86% less land than conventional animal sources.1 It all adds up to real impact for our planet:We've saved over 361 million gallons of water, 1.46 million kg of CO2, and 2.5 million square meters of land.Some of you are motivated by tackling climate change, others are motivated by good omelets, and others just saw it in the fridge and were curious if a plant could actually scramble (it can).Regardless of your motivation, you should know that you're a part of something big: a mission to make it easier for everyone to eat well. It's a story of meat lovers, egg lovers, and plant lovers. Of the young football player wanting protein before practice in Birmingham and the Beijing businesswoman wanting a breakfast she can feel good about.We have a long way to go, it's going to take a lot more of us to get there, and we won't be the only solution.

Our founders, Alex and Andrew, have been around the ocean their entire lives. They both grew up on the Florida coast, swimming, diving, fishing, and surfing. After becoming friends in college, they saved up their money for the surf trip of a lifetime to Bali. When they arrived, they found a beach that was completely covered in plastic, with trash-filled waves delivering more garbage with each break.
They asked a local why such a popular, and otherwise beautiful, shoreline wasn't kept clean, and were told that the beaches had been cleaned just hours earlier. The trash they were wading through had only just washed ashore.
Their eyes were immediately opened to the magnitude of the ocean plastic crisis, and they vowed on the spot to try to do something about it.
Alex and Andrew decided to hire boat captains and other local workers to clean the ocean and coastlines full time. In order to make the biggest impact on this global problem, they launched their efforts in places like Bali where a lot of plastic and other garbage regularly accumulates.
Inspired by successful lifestyle brands that were able to build passionate followings, they decided to implement a business model that would allow them to grow quickly so they could pay workers, fund cleanups, and spread the word about the ocean plastic crisis.
So they created the 4ocean bracelet and pledged to pull a pound of trash from the ocean for each one purchased, using the profits to scale cleanup operations, make donations to ocean-related nonprofits, and build an organizational infrastructure to support future growth.
Even though 4ocean has collected millions of pounds of trash from the ocean and built an international infrastructure to fight the ocean plastic crisis, we're just getting started. The ocean plastic crisis is massive and growing.
It will take major systemic changes and the hard work of many great organizations each trying to tackle the crisis in different ways, as well as people like you who are committed to driving change.

It has done this primarily, but not exclusively, by way of its work on fair shares effort sharing in the context of a global emergency climate mobilization.  This goal has been pursued, first, via the Greenhouse Development Rights project and, more recently, by way of its successor the Climate Equity Reference Project.EcoEquity was founded in 1999 by Tom Athanasiou and Paul Baer. Paul died in September 2016. See here for his memorial page. His death was a blow, but the project is ongoing, as is this website, which functions both as a portal into EcoEquity's work and as Tom Athanasiou's climate equity blog.EcoEquity is focused on political and theoretical work on climate solutions that are fair enough to actually work.  Through its participation in domestic and international networks of activists and scholars, it argues for emergency climate strategies that protect the poor, and more generally protect the rights of all people to dignified levels of just and sustainable development.This does not in any way imply a repudiation of realism.  It does mean the rejection of forced optimism, and a keen focus on approaches to the climate transition in which the politics of economic justice and the politics of emergency climate mobilization are one and the same.EcoEquity works by emphasizing the importance of equity principles in all aspects of the policy response, by producing political and economic analyses and educational materials that highlight equity issues, and by developing practical proposals for equitable climate policies.  Its focus has been on the international negotiations but it  also promotes domestic approaches to climate justice that explicitly and organically expand into the project of a just global transition.  Indeed, EcoEquity is working more and more on the domestic front, a fact that will become obvious in the next edition of the Climate Equity Reference Calculator.EcoEquity has done a great deal.  Our greatest accomplishment has clearly been the development, along with colleagues at the Stockholm Environment Institute, of the Climate Equity Reference Framework. You can find much more information about the CERP at its website at Climate Equity Reference Project.EcoEquity is a virtual organization that lives as its projects and its partnerships, and as this website, which is curated by Tom Athanasiou, EcoEquity's Executive Director."

RE-volv empowers people and communities to invest collectively in renewable energy
Vision
We envision a world where people are thriving in communities powered by clean energy
Our Theory of Change
We believe that everyone should have the ability to support and spread clean energy.
So we created a new way for people to take action. It's a pretty simple idea. We crowdsource funding to put solar panels on community-serving nonprofit organizations. As these organizations pay us back, we reinvest the money into more solar projects in communities across the country. This creates a revolving fund for solar energy that continually perpetuates itself building more and more solar.
It's a pay-it-forward model for solar energy. We call it the Solar Seed Fund.
How It Works
Nonprofits save 15% or more on their electric bills when they go solar with RE-volv. These organizations save money on their electric costs while paying RE-volv back through a Power Purchase Agreement or lease.
Those payments are reinvested in a revolving fund, the Solar Seed Fund, which continually finances more nonprofit solar projects.

ConnectMyEV's charging system is based on its proprietary conductive hands free charging technology which is 100% efficient and is scalable to high power levels required for DC fast charging. Being conductive, it's capable of orchestrating large power swings to optimally take advantage of real-time energy pricing. This can significantly lower the cost of charging your EV and in some cases even pay you back to charge.ConnectMyEV, technology can be retrofitted onto an EV or can be deployed as an add-on accessory at the time of EV purchase. The charging system comprises of (i) a ground side unit, (ii) a vehicle side unit, (iii) a dongle that plugs into OBD-II port, (iv) a wall unit and (v) an app for your smart phone. The ground side unit has a low profile and it can be placed on the surface of garage floor or where you would normally park your EV - such as a driveway. The vehicle side unit - which is the size of a smartphone, receives the energy from the deployed arm of ground side unit. The energy received is routed to the SAE-J-1772 charge port that exists on all EVs.Once connected, the ConnectMyEV system will communicate to utility servers to acquire real-time pricing information. ConnectMyEV's optimizing computer then takes into account instantaneous and predicted energy prices, any ""transactional energy"" coupons you may have purchased and the constraints as to when the vehicle readiness is required. With this information, it will chart a course - and continually correct it, to charge your EV so that it's ready when you want it, while minimizing the overall cost to charge. This not only saves you money, but also eases the electricity grid loading."

We exist to replace the old extractive systems, and revolutionize them with new forms of sustainable production that are good for business and the planet. Carbon transformation involves breaking down carbon into its fundamental elements and building them back up into healthy nutrients and a range of bio-based products that are friendlier to our planet. In recognizing that the existing supply chain model is unfit for the needs of our planet and growing population, we have created a series of commercial solutions that set a new bar in the circular economy by transforming carbon instead of extracting further resources from our planet.With 50+ patents granted or pending on our NASA-inspired technology, we are addressing key supply chain challenges from price volatility, land and water usage, to overall efficiency all while creating new ways of making products that leverage existing resources and are less extractive and detrimental to our planet.The inspiration behind Kiverdi began in the 1960's with NASA on a quest for deep space travel. The scientists, challenged with how to produce food for a year-long mission with limited space and resources, soon discovered a special class of microbes. These natural single-cell organisms, specifically, called hydrogenotrophs, act like plants in converting carbon dioxide into food. The concept was simple. Astronauts would exhale CO2, which would be captured by the microbes, then converted, with other inputs such as power and water, into food, which would feed the astronauts. The astronauts would exhale CO2, further enabling the hydrogenotrophs to continue producing an endless cycle of nutrients. Leveraging NASA's concepts, we are applying the same thinking to our planet. Not only are we capturing our over abundance of CO2, but we are using it as the key input in creating nutrients and bio-based products. With 36 billion tons of CO2 emitted around the globe each year, we know our work is just beginning. We have 46+ patents granted or pending of carbon transformation technology that can be applied to a range of industries. We are not just reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but also leading a new era of sustainable production on how we make the food and everyday products to support our growing population. "

Standard: Establishes the core rules and requirements that must be met for any project, program or activity to be certified under the framework. Depending on the circumstances, our standards may set out higher-level requirements or, for more complex endeavors, include more detailed rules and procedures.
Independent Assessment: Ensures that projects, programs and activities meet our standards. Where standards require independent auditing or verification, we establish processes for accrediting auditors, overseeing their work, and sanctioning them if they underperform. We provide support and oversight to established accreditation programs to ensure cost-effective and high-quality independent auditing.
Accounting Methodologies: Allow for the determination of baselines (ie, what would have happened in the absence of the project, policy or program) and set out specific parameters for measuring, accounting and monitoring impacts.
Registry: Displays the performance of projects, programs or activities to allow tracking of results or, in some cases, tradable units. The final programmatic component of a typical standards framework and essential to functioning certification markets, registries provide tracking services to account holders and transparent project documentation to the public."

However, the battery industry is limited by the diagnostic tools and sensors at its disposal as there is no accurate, scalable, non-invasive way to measure the physical processes within a battery during operation.Technology vision: Our vision is to improve the way batteries are made, tested, and managed by providing the industry with low-cost, non-destructive, physical diagnostics in real time and at scale.Current state-of-the-art: Physical analysis of batteries can be carried out with x-ray, electron, or neutron sources, but these methods are expensive and are not deployable in commercial installations. On-line testing of state of charge and state of health is done mainly with electrical techniques, which may interrupt operation, deplete charge, and only provide cell-averaged, abstract information of internal features.Key innovation: The behavior of sound in a battery is sensitive to any changes in the physical properties along the path of acoustic waves. Leveraging know-how from seismology, acoustic analysis of batteries offers direct and detailed information about their internal components and physical structure, which electrical, thermal, and strain-based methods cannot.Manufacturing challenges: As we decrease the geometric footprint and cost of our system, the biggest challenge will be to maintain the repeatability and quality of measured signals.Competing technology: There is a growing effort in developing new, real-time physical diagnostic methods for batteries, but most have been limited to experimental systems. Truly in operando diagnostic methods have been limited to neutron or x-ray methods, which are not scalable, and to strain or thermal techniques, which are indirect and cell-averaged.First market hypothesis: Currently, our initial target is the battery manufacturing market to improve yield and quality control.Potential for impact: The need for better batteries is keeping many promising technologies from widespread adoption.

The primary hurdles restricting market growth of these chemicals is their current high production cost or environmentally hazardous production process. We address both these problems using a low-cost microbial fermentation technology, enabling over $25B in downstream value to be unlocked using our technology.We make our products using commercially proven, acid-tolerant yeast. We have developed a suite of high-throughput engineering technologies that enable us to rapidly prototype and optimize our microbes, enabling low-cost, rapid technology scaleup.Many of our target products are organic acids, compounds that are expensive to synthesize using petrochemistry but can be produced at high theoretical yield microbially. A high yielding process means less sugar is required to produce each kilogram of product, decreasing operating costs and lowering exposure to changing raw material (e.g., corn) prices. For some compounds, a theoretical yield greater than 100% can be achieved by sinking carbon dioxide. Low operating costs is a fundamental reason why microbial production of organic acids (e.g., itaconic, lactic, citric, and succinic acids) has been more successful than biofuels (e.g., farnesane, bio-diesel, butanol, and ethanol)."

TIPA was founded to create viable compostable, flexible packaging solutions









Packaging should behave just like an orange peel, so nature won’t even notice we’re here
The segments of an orange are packed by nature in a protective multilayer peel.When discarded, the orange peel decomposes and leaves no toxic residue; the compost left behind can be used as fertilizer for plant growth. 100% of the orange peel returns to nature.
TIPA was founded in 2010 by Daphna Nissenbaum and Tal Neuman to address the plastic waste challenge.
TIPA’s vision is for flexible packaging to have the same end-of-life as organic matter, while still offering consumers and brands the durability, transparency and shelf life they have come to expect from conventional plastics.
Yet compostable packaging can only succeed if it meets the same performance specifications as conventional plastic packaging. Compostable packaging should also be able to seamlessly fit into today’s methodology of logistics and manufacturing practices.


 







The Flexible Packaging Challenge
Plastic used for food and beverage packaging makes up two-thirds of the world’s plastic waste.  Rigid (non-flexible) food plastic packaging is partly recyclable.
However, flexible packaging (packages such as fresh produce, coffee, snacks, granola bars, etc.) is a growing segment of the world’s packaging market. Even though the volume of flexible packaging is smaller by weight and space, most flexible packaging cannot be practically recycled. Flexible packaging isn’t made of pure plastic polymers but rather made by blending several materials. These blended materials make flexible packaging complicated for separation and recycling.
We share our vision as an incentive to overcome this challenge with a growing community around the globe, including consumers and brands that strive for a circular economy approach, and wish that compostable packaging will become a day-to-day solution for both food and packaging waste.

What makes us unique?

A track record of reducing greenhouse gas emissions: The Climate Center played a pivotal role in rapidly expanding Community Choice Energy in California, from 2 agencies in 2014 to 19 agencies today.

A well-developed theory of change (strategy) that describes the optimum way to deliver rapid greenhouse gas reductions at scale.

We believe that to achieve a positive, vibrant future for ourselves, our children and all life, we must build an unprecedented cross-sectoral coalition of climate advocates who demand accelerated, equitable climate policies that unleash market forces and make climate-friendly choices easier for everyone. California, as the world’s fifth largest economy, must step up its climate leadership to catalyze action by other states, nations, and the world for a climate-safe Earth.


The bold, comprehensive Climate-Safe California campaign that describes how California can respond with urgency to the climate crisis, meaning much more accelerated goals and action for greenhouse gas reductions. This is the primary focus of our work.

The climate crisis is here now, worse than anticipated, and accelerating, threatening all life, from humans to wildlife. With 9 of 15 global tipping points activated, what we do today can either unleash an inhospitable hothouse Earth or secure a safe climate. Per the latest science, massive reductions of warming emissions with the beginning of drawdown from the atmosphere are required by 2030 to prevent catastrophic impacts. Our only hope is to enact bold policies now, not decades later. Climate-Safe California is an urgent, powerful solution to ensure that California, the world’s 5th largest economy, steps up its leadership, enacts accelerated climate policy timelines and catalyzes other states, our nation, and other countries to action.

By definition, Agritecture is about applying architectural thinking when designing agriculture for the built environment.

In practice, architects and urban farmers incorporate agriculture into the surrounding city environment in very different ways. Architects frequently design impossible vertical farming and urban agriculture concepts that ignore the realities of successful farming operations. In contrast, agriculturalists and entrepreneurs often miss important design, aesthetic, and social integration opportunities when they develop urban farms. Agritecture is about integrating the disciplines of agriculture and architecture so that urban farms can be both practical and well-designed all at once.

 Today, Agritecture’s blog covers a wide range of global and local urban agriculture news, including topics such as: greenhouse production, vertical farming, aquaponics, hydroponics, regenerative agriculture, ag-tech, and food systems more broadly. Agritecture’s consulting services are designed to help entrepreneurs, developers, and cities plan and launch successful agritecture, urban agriculture, vertical farming, and local food system projects.

A lot of people ask us “what is Agritecture”? To help you better understand what Agritecture is, we have curated a selection of projects and concepts below that illustrate the concept and successfully balance the art, science, and business of integrating agriculture into the built environment."

One of the most daunting issues humanity faces is a mounting waste problem, which not only destroys the environment but also obstructs public health and threatens to drown poorer nations in unimaginable and irreparable pollution.

At Asta Works, we strive to reduce the damage of inefficient waste management (which includes climate change, by the way). Reduce and reuse is always best but if that’s not an option, recycling is the move. Unfortunately, 40% of what’s sent to the recycling center ends up in the landfill. Yep, not great. That’s why we created a new process that reinvents recycling as you know it; using barcode technology, we are able to provide transparency and personalization to your recycling for the first time ever. By accepting pre-separated waste and sending them directly to manufacturers, we guarantee that more gets recycled, thus keeping the environment healthy, happy and green. You’re welcome.

Not sold yet? We’ve simplified recycling by offering pick-ups straight to your door, at the tap of your phone. You'll be able to see the impact of your recycling calculated with the utmost accuracy. Receive personalized feedback after each pick-up to become the best recycler you can be. Last but not least, you'll be able to track your recyclables all the way from your home to the point of recycling. Waste is effectively reused and our air, earth and oceans revert to their unspoiled beauty, one plastic bottle at a time. Let’s keep it natural (as it should be).

Our mission is to save the environment and reward you in the process. Think outside the box… and recycle it."

Changes in power generation - increasing additions in renewable capacity, decrease in generation and increase in flexibility for conventional power plants.

""Decarbonization"" of heating and transport - operation of electrical components which are supplied by increasingly CO2 free generated electricity (e-vehicles, heat pumps)

Decoupling of generation and consumption - the consumption of electricity will be synchronized with generation to some extent via storage and demand side management.

Distributed energy - the share of distributed generation will grow, e.g. photovoltaics, micro CHP (combined heat and power), which can even serve as reserve margin in times of low renewable electricity production.

Integrated infrastructure - an integrated infrastructure for information and communication will be the backbone of such a distributed energy system and links together the various components in residential areas, offices, and industry.

This company named BIOeCON was founded in 2006 and in 2007 it started a Joint Venture named KiOR. This Joint Venture went public in an IPO and is now traded on NASDAQ. At this moment KiOR has started its first commercial plant in Columbus, Mississippi, and is producing cellulosic gasoline and diesel from forestry wastes.

In 2010 BIOeCON entered into a Joint Development Agreement, this time with a state owned oil giant from Brazil called Petrobras. The project named BiCHEM is focused on developing an technology for the production of high value chemicals and fuel additives from agricultural wastes. This technology is now being scaled-up by an international R & D team at the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

After the establishment of KiOR, BIOeCON founder Paul O’Connor decided that the next logical step from bio-based fuels would be solar fuels and so he founded in 2010, together with his companion Sasa Marinic, the company Antecy with the goal of developing technologies for renewable and sustainable energy production. After all, biomass is nothing more than million years of solar radiation stored via biomass like plants and trees into fossil fuels like natural gas, coal and oil.

So actually, Antecy does the same as what nature does, namely producing a fuel with help of the energy of the sun, only more efficient.

While biomass is able to absorb approximately 1–2 % of the sun’s radiation and after converting it to a fuel, there is only 0.6 – 1.2 % of the solar energy left. PV on the other hand can absorb approximately 23 % and after converting it using the Antecy technology there is still more than 10 % of the solar energy left and we must keep in mind that the efficiency of PV still shall improve the coming years."

Members are committed to creating a healthy and resilient Bay Area for land and people.

We will use “resilient lands and people” to express our coalition’s goals of a) preventing the loss and/or degradation of land, b) supporting ecological functioning, and c) connecting people to the land. We focus on resilience – an ability to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change (Mirriam Webster) – because it is essential in the 21st century.

We include public parks, public lands, working lands like farms and ranches and forests, rural and  urban lands, trails, open spaces, preserves, and other similar natural spaces.

We include acquisition, stewardship, maintenance, restoration, preservation, conservation, cultural resources and activities, outdoor recreation, public access to nature, active living as part of public health, and programs that connect people to nature.

We are the only Bay Area coalition of nonprofits, agencies, and Tribes focused on resilient lands and people, and we are unique in how we work because:

We work together to secure significant public funds and engage in regional policy for climate resilience and equitable access to nature.
We leverage coalition members’ local work at the regional scale.
We deliver more impactful outcomes for resilient land and people than any local organization or agency could."

Specifically, the FRB leverages increasingly scarce public dollars for forest restoration through the following mechanisms: (1) sharing costs (and benefits) to reduce aggregate costs to each individual stakeholder; (2) tapping private capital to allow for amortization of costs over time; and (3) accelerating restoration treatments to prevent further overgrowth and future costs to stakeholders.

Once successful, the FRB will serve as a new public-private partnership model to enhance climate resilience."

We are a land of towns and communities, many with airports, but few with regular air service. Our stock of 13,500 airports is the largest in the world, yet just 140 of the largest hubs carry over 97% of air traffic.

Communities without good air service also struggle to attract investment and create jobs.

Electric aircraft of varying sizes are ideally suited to this critical need, requiring little support other than a GPS flight path and a quick recharge or swap facility on the tarmac. Be it Moses Lake, Beaumont, Santa Fe or Butte: prepare for the convenience of frequent electric air service.

We specialize in technologies which can be installed with minimum disruption and expense. Our products, such as the Wireless Pneumatic Thermostat, Wireless Gauge Reader or Wireless Steam Trap Monitor, require minutes to install, cost a fraction of traditional solutions, and typically pay back within 18 months.

THE CHALLENGE

Managers at older facilities must often tolerate dated legacy technologies such as pneumatic thermostats, mechanical steam traps, and manual gauges. Compared to new state-of-the art plants or buildings, these sites typically consume more energy, require more maintenance labor, incur higher unplanned downtime, and deliver lower yield or productivity. In today’s competitive business environment, these factors put older facilities at a serious disadvantage.

Although many plant and building operators would like to upgrade their facilities with the latest automation technology, the cost of running new wires, disrupting existing occupants or production, and triggering potential safety code upgrades makes it unfeasible. As an operator of existing manufacturing plants and buildings in over a dozen sites worldwide, Cypress understands these challenges first hand."

Initially, the technology was applied to develop an agricultural model to analyze corn and soy production in the United States. Using imagery from various satellite constellations, weather data, and other datasets, the model accurately predicted yield six months prior to the end of the growing season.

Realizing the potential for the technology applied to use cases around the globe, Descartes Labs turned its focus to developing a cloud-based supercomputing platform for the application of machine intelligence to massive data sets. This platform could be used by anyone to develop intelligent learning models to do science on data, and make that data actionable.

Capitalizing on the confluence of advances in AI and high-performance cloud computing – along with the rapid increase of sensors capturing information all over the globe – Descartes Labs has created an enterprise data refinery that enables organizations to model – and predict changes in – natural resources and the entire value chains in which they live. With an initial focus on satellite imagery, Descartes Labs processes a pipeline of data flows from all the major satellite constellations, at scale, to provide instant access to analysis-ready images of the entire world via a massive, searchable, on-demand interface. For example, petabytes of imagery can be searched and retrieved, and all features from various constellations accessed, in under 100 milliseconds.

By collecting, normalizing, and presenting science-ready data generated by satellites, the Descartes Labs Platform is advancing and accelerating unique applications of machine intelligence for consumers, corporations, and governments worldwide.

eChemion develops advanced materials for energy storage and power generation markets. Our focus is to design and manufacture materials that improve performance while simultaneously improving our customers’ gross margins. With an electrical infrastructure capable of generating and distributing renewable energy, eChemion believes the cost of renewable energy should converge on being “free,” with the only recurrent cost arising in maintenance fees. However, due to the misalignment between when energy demand is placed on the grid and when renewable energy generation can be provided to the grid, renewable energy must have a way of being stored until it is needed. This last hurdle is energy storage and this is why we’ve chosen to focus on this market for our first product launch, a bipolar plate called eC17 that is used by Redox Flow Battery Manufacturers.

MISSION:
eChemion provides engineered solutions for the energy storage industry with the higher purpose of supporting the global transition to more resilient and reliable electrical infrastructures that can rely entirely on renewable energy resources.

VISION:
eChemion seeks to enable a global transition to renewable energy dependency by becoming the world’s leading low-cost, high-performance component supplier of energy storage devices.

“
The future of energy should be free. We are vastly improving the way energy is stored and managed, which will lead to reliable energy for everyone.
— Bill Kesselring, CEO, eChemion

CORE VALUES:
Sustainability - Individually and as a team, eChemion employees seek to create a more sustainable world at every level of the organization, whether it is through internal efficiency improvements or via engineered solutions that increase product lifespan and reduce waste.

Energy Equity - At eChemion, we believe that unlocking the potential of energy storage products will create a more just and equitable world by enabling low-cost storage and distribution of electricity to anyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status or country of origin.

Diversity - Our world is rich with diverse people, cultures, skills, and mindsets; at eChemion, we believe that any successful solution for such a world must originate from a team that reflects this diversity of backgrounds, ideas, and solutions.

Innovation - At the core of our existence is a drive to solve the energy challenges facing the world today; a drive that fuels our passion for developing market-focused solutions that enable the global transition to greater electrical grid resiliency, safety, and sustainability."

6487,Permaculture Institute/Buena Vista Park Foundation,[251-500],www.bvu.edu/,Research & Education,"San Francisco, CA, USA","Permaculture is the harmonious integration of landscape and people. Permaculture, being bounded by the ethics of care of people, care of earth and reinvestment of surplus, can provide food, energy, shelter, and other material and non-material needs in a sustainable way. The specific purpose of the SF Permaculture Guild is to support a local community of those interested in permaculture by producing educational and social events, enabling permaculture projects and providing opportunities to exchange information related to permaculture design.

History:
The San Francisco Permaculture Guild (SFPG) was started in the late 1990s as a series of informal gatherings of individuals who have studied permaculture, or who are looking for more information about this system of design and resources for putting to practical use in San Francisco.  A listserve was started sometime around 2001 for faciliating  communication amongst permaculture designers and enthusiasts in San Francisco.  In the summer of 2006, the first Permaculture Design Certificate Course taught in San Francisco was facilitated at the SF Botanical Garden.  There were more than 30 students in this class taught by Kat Steele, Kevin Bayuk and Fred Bové along with a number of guest presenters.  Among those was Geoff Lawton, a respected world-renown permaculture teacher with many years of experience in community organizing.  His advice to the class was to meet regularly, and form a more formal association for the advancement of community knowledge and skills.  From this advice grew a more concerted effort to initiate regular SFPG meetings, first, held in the same classrooms at the SF Botanical Garden where the first SF permaculture classes were offered.  These informal meetings grew in size and changed venues to accommodate the number and diversity of the attendees.In the years since the Guild has been meeting, several themes have emerged in response to community need:

continuing education
sharing of resources
networking
creating opportunities and projects at the community level.
To that end, the SF Permaculture Guild decided to form an informal governance council, to sustain the original vision of the organization and plan the path forward.    In 2010, the Guild decided officially incorporate in the state of California as a for public benefit corporation (a 501c3 organization) to respond to the needs of its constituents (i.e., enble the raising for funds and capacity through donations to be distributed to the community in service of the  mission of the organization).

What do we do:
The San Francisco Permacutlure Guild engages in or plans to engage in (at least)  the following activities:

Produce regular meetings and events to provide opportunities for participants in the guild to connect and share ideas and resources.
Facilitate the initiation of and incubate new permaculture projects in San Francisco.
Solicit ideas and resources for new permaculture projects in San Francisco.
Connect new permaculture design projects in San Francisco with resources, including volunteers and funding.
Maintain a website for collection of information about existing and potential permaculture projects in San Francisco.
Maintain an email listserve for the dissemination of information and discussion about permaculture in San Francisco."

6141,Hollywood Electrics,[101-250],hollywoodelectrics.com/,Transportation,"West Hollywood, CA, USA","Myth #1 – Electric Motorcycles are slow – WRONG
If you still believe Electric Vehicles are slow, you’ve been living under a rock. The Zero SR has been boasting a 0-60mph time of 3.3 seconds since it was introduced in 2014. This figure is on par with any liter bike, but to eliminate any doubt we only need to look to the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb of 2013. The Lightning Electric Superbike made it to the summit in 10 minutes flat, the fastest motorcycle to run the event that year.

Myth #2 – Electric Motorcycles are expensive – WRONG
Consider the cost of ownership to realize how shortsighted it is to take the price of a motorcycle at face value. We’ve taken the cost of fuel and expensive maintenance for granted our entire lives. An everyday rider like myself could easily spend $1500-$2000 per year on premium gasoline in Los Angeles, not to mention the costs incurred by all the maintenance a high performance motorcycle demands. Between oil changes, valve adjustments, clutch replacements, and other miscellaneous maintenance that an ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) demands, it’s easy to see how this can nearly match the cost of fuel. It would only take a few years for a seemingly inexpensive and reasonable bike like a Yamaha FZ-09 to exceed the cost of a high performance Zero SR.

Myth #3 – Electric Motorcycle don’t go far enough on a charge – WRONG
The fact that we’re still hearing this falsehood on a daily basis, when the range of new Zero Motorcycles actually exceeds that of many popular ICE vehicles, just goes to show how stubborn and opposed to change we actually are. The new Zero Motorcycles can travel nearly 200 miles on a charge in the city or about 100 miles at highway speeds. For comparison, a Harley Sportster empties its gas tank after about 80 miles, a Ducati Monster will get about 120 miles, and the Yamaha FZ-07 about 140 miles.

Obviously the next argument is that the tank on any of these vehicles can be quickly refilled with a short stop at the gas station, but it is much more inconvenient to stop at a gas station than to simply plug my electric motorcycle in at home, work, or any of the thousands of EV charging stations. Since 99.9% of my riding is done within my local area, I hardly ever find myself limited by the range of the battery. Until the charging infrastructure matures to the point where there are 5-min charging stations, Hollywood Electrics offers a simple and effective solution for reducing charging time, namely our Elcon Quick Charger.

Myth #4 – Electric Motorcycles are more polluting than a gas vehicle – WRONG
Keep telling yourself that your smelly, smoky ICE vehicle is cleaner than the plants that power my Electric Motorcycle. I hope it helps you sleep at night. If not, you can just walk down to your garage, crawl into the backseat of your car and warm up that internal combustion engine. Of course you wouldn’t do that because you know you’d be inhaling dangerous amounts of carbon monoxide and other poisonous gases. Then you’d tell me that the coal plants that generate our electricity are just displacing our emissions or that the mining and processing of the minerals for batteries is more environmentally damaging. I refer you to this study by the Union of Concerned Scientists that concludes that EVs are much cleaner from cradle to the grave.

Myth #5 –  Electric Motorcycles are dangerous because “Loud Pipes Save Lives” – WRONG
This is by far the most ignorant statement I hear on a daily basis. If anybody actually believes someone in a car is going to notice the sound of their bike when the windows are up, the radio is on, or the driver is talking and texting on their cell phone, then that rider is asking for trouble. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen near collisions between Emergency Vehicles whose sirens are blaring, and another driver who clearly did not hear them coming. Motorcycles have a distinct disadvantage to an emergency vehicle. Unlike a siren that alerts drivers in front of the vehicle, the exhaust of an ICE motorcycle points backwards.

I actually find the silence of my Electric Motorcycle to be comforting because I am more aware of everything around me. Additionally, one of the constant grievances I hear from non-riders is how annoying loud motorcycles are. I could go on ad nauseum about the reasons this myth is wrong, but it has been debunked numerous times in articles like this one on Revzilla."

Benefits: THE ENVIRONMENT: Industrial animal agriculture contributes around 15% of the earth���s total greenhouse gas emissions. Making meat from cells reduces greenhouse gases by 96% while using 99% less land, 96% less water, and 45% less energy. HUMAN HEALTH: Animal factory farming creates antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Humans are now using antibiotics of “last resort” to prevent deadly infections. More antibiotics are used on pigs per pound than on any other animal – 4x more than cows! ANIMAL WELL-BEING: 7.4 billion humans live on earth. We keep around 40 billion animals for food. Some of them live happy lives, but the vast majority do not. Our first pork sausages were made from a few cells from a pig named Jessie. In the future, we won’t need cells or meat from animals, allowing them to live their own, natural lives."

Mallinda's patented resin system eliminates the slow infusion and long curing cycles of today's resins; enabling compression-molding of products in just seconds for high-throughput, high-volume production of structural composites. In addition, our prepreg is pre-cured, shelf-stable, and requires no refrigeration for transport and storage.

Mallinda's prepreg resin is a disruptive platform technology that allows rapid (< 1 minute) compression molding of fully cured thermoset composite parts. It is designed for carbon fiber composite production using rapid compression molding techniques analogous to sheet metal stamping. In addition, Mallinda’s resin can be depolymerized in solution for a cradle-to-cradle, energy-neutral system for the recovery of resin and woven/full-length fiber.

A Range of Processing Temperatures & Range of Mechanical Properties

Mallinda’s resin can be formulated to have a low molding temperature range. Our resin can be molded at temperatures as low as ~20 ̊C and as high as ~150 ̊C, depending on formulation. In some applications, this feature has the benefit of allowing end-users to custom mold our resin or composites derived therefrom, to suit the end user’s needs without the use of expensive and massive industrial equipment.

In addition, Mallinda's material can be formulated to have a range of mechanical properties - from elastomeric to crystalline.

Mallinda is currently developing its material to meet the specs of the automotive market.

Short Cycle Times & Repairability

Due to the malleable nature of our resin, fully cured composite sheets can be perfectly welded together in less than 1 minute.  This means that Mallinda’s composites can be substituted for prepreg sheet, but can be stored at room temperature (or higher) indefinitely, and do not require a curing step.  Only heat and pressure are required to mold the cured sheets into shape, and similarly, heat and pressure treatment can heal or repair damage (such as impact damage) in the material.

Reprocessable

Mallinda’s resin may be recycled many times over. The plastic may be ground into a powder and reformed into new shapes with heat and pressure. This both increases the input lifetime vis-a-vis recycling and reduces the energy required during repurposing.

In addition, Mallinda's ability to implement solid state thermoforming could revolutionize production of powder-based composite materials.

Environmentally Friendly Synthesis

No heavy metal catalysts or organic solvents are used in making our resin. And the only byproduct in the chemical production is water.

What does this mean?

It means that we have created one of the most user-friendly plastic materials to date."

by working with the indigenous communities that call them home.
 

The Rainforest Foundation works on-the-ground to secure land rights for indigenous people. We strengthen indigenous land security and train indigenous communities to use technology to protect their forests. By investing directly in indigenous communities, we connect people who are deeply motivated to conserve their ancestral lands with the tools, training, and resources necessary to protect their rainforests.

WHY WE DO IT
Human life depends on our rainforests. They are vital to the stability of our climate. Rainforests are carbon sinks that surpass our most sophisticated technology; they absorb 30% of the world’s CO2 emissions each year.

Rainforests are also home to more than half of the world’s animal and plant species.  They are a constant source of life-saving medicines. Millions of indigenous peoples depend on the forest for their survival, including our planet’s last uncontacted cultures.

Despite rainforests importance, they are disappearing. Today, we have lost more than half of earth’s original rainforests—every year we lose an area of tropical forest the size of New York State.

But together we are making a difference. To date, we have protected more than 33 million acres of rainforest. Indigenous communities of the rainforest are fighting back, holding the front line for all of us. With your support, Indigenous communities can protect the forests we all depend on for generations to come. 

 

HOW WE WORK
The Rainforest Foundation always works in partnership with indigenous communities and organizations. Together, we protect their forests by securing rights to their territories, strengthening sustainable land management and monitoring their forests.

We:

Supply legal and technical support so that indigenous communities have the information needed to make decisions and influence public policy.
Build networks of indigenous technical experts who manage and analyze satellite data, monitor their forests and take action to keep illegal loggers, miners, and traffickers off of their ancestral lands.  
Support leaders and indigenous institutions, the cornerstone of effective advocacy and community-based conservation.
Provide on-the-ground equipment and training to partners so they can use smartphone, drone and satellite technology in defense of their land.
OUR HISTORY
Sting Rainforest Foundation RaoniThe Rainforest Foundation was founded with a radically new idea:

What if indigenous people of the rainforest–those intimately connected to their ancestral lands–had the legal right to protect the forests we all depend on?

When the Rainforest Foundation began, 30 years ago, environmental organizations didn’t focus on human rights. People living in the rainforest were seen as part of the problem. But one of our founders, Sting, listened to the Kayapo—an Indigenous community living deep in the Brazilian Amazon—and saw that supporting Indigenous communities was the best way to protect rainforests and the cultures that depend on them.

Today data from satellite images and drone footage prove that defending indigenous rights isn’t just the right thing to do, it is the most effective way to protect our forests. It is a fact: rainforests protected by Indigenous communities have the lowest rates of deforestation in Central and South America."

Triton is a highly efficient multi-mode point absorber that consists of a catenary moored surface float connected to an optimally-shaped, vertically asymmetric heave plate by three taut, flexible tethers. Unlike most conventional WECs, Triton’s surface float is excited by ocean waves in multiple modes – heave, pitch, surge and roll – allowing for increased energy capture across a wide range of ocean conditions enabling a substantially lower levelized cost of electricity.
Triton’s projected performance is based on extensive numerical modeling validated by tank testing at 1:50 scale. Testing of a 1:20 scale model is planned for Q3 2016.

HIGH EFFICIENCY ENERGY CAPTURE & CONVERSION
Triton’s drivetrain uses a variable linear hydraulic gearbox to amplify and transfer loads from the tethers to the generators. The gearbox is a high reliability hydrostatic system similar to that used in hydraulic presses. It delivers the benefits of a conventional rotary gearbox without complex moving parts. Specifically, it also allows for optimum matching of the wave-generated forces to the generator input forces, so that the generators operate at maximum efficiency while allowing the appropriate system compliance for coupling with the input wave.
Every WEC has an optimal force/displacement profile for maximum mechanical energy capture and efficiency in each wave condition. Triton’s linear gearbox design allows the load amplification factor to be adjusted to optimal levels during operation based on the wave state, enabling generator displacements to be maintained at an optimum level that is largely independent of the surface float’s displacement, maximizing power transfer over a wider range of sea states than other WECs.

The linear gearbox thus makes a significant contribution to the wide power bandwidth, increased reliability, and reduced cost. It also enables various non-continuous control strategies such as latching and declutching without imposing excess loadings on the generator or marine system, which may enable the use of advanced active control algorithms to boost power in lower sea states. Optimization of the linear drivetrain, including the linear gearbox, is being funded by Wave Energy Scotland."

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
Decarbonization of the electricity grid is an essential component to solving climate change and recognizing this, a tremendous effort is underway to bring renewable generation onto the grid, such as wind and solar.

However, grid decarbonization today is at an impasse. The intermittency of renewable generators are causing ever larger power swings on the grid, leading to blackouts and forced curtailments. Without a cost-effective electricity storage solution to buffer those swings and ""shift"" renewable power to when the grids needs it, renewables will be nothing but a niche source of clean power.

Water is a vital energy resource and can be utilized to efficiently store electricity at extremely large capacities.

RNAi, which is an abbreviation for RNA interference, is a technology that relies on gene regulation without the heritable effects on DNA. Because RNAi works downstream from DNA, it is not genetic modification and therefore is non-GMO. RNAgri has developed technology that will allow the cost-efficient production of RNA for topical RNAi uses in broad acre agriculture and in urban-structural pest control. Other high use rate applications for RNA such as for RNAi in aquaculture or animal husbandry could also benefit.

RNAi has potential to provide non-GMO traits in the field without genetic modification. RNAi is extremely specific and can provide very selective insect control without potential for off target effects; this opens up the potential for beneficial insects and improvements in biodiversity. This technology can reverse herbicide resistance in weeds and pesticide resistance in insects.

The agricultural traits and agricultural and urban and structural pest control businesses provide enormous value to society and generate billions of dollars in revenue for major agricultural companies. RNAi based products will provide complements and replacements for many current technologies and thus will create enormous value for agricultural companies and for society at large.

RNAgri has dependable third party validation of its Intellectual Property as well as unfettered freedom to operate. It is represented by a preeminent legal firm with a track record in biotech IP."

Our mission is to make it easy to build custom homes that are healthy, sustainable, and durable.
We manufacture custom single and multifamily homes that are high-quality, sustainable, healthy, and durable. We empower individuals, architects, and small developers who want to build their own projects – and who want an efficient and reliable solution. And peace of mind during the process. We work with your architects on your custom designs or you can work with our Design Partners or select Standard Homes they have created for us.

We are the first home factory in the nation dedicated to sustainable construction, materials, processes, and operations. We believe homes can and should be built in ways that minimize their negative impact on energy, water, resources — and the health of the people who live in our homes and who build them. We know that in-factory construction can be faster, more cost-effective, and more reliable than on-site construction. And we know it saves neighborhoods from months of noise pollution, traffic and disruption.

Plant was spun out of LivingHomes, a design and development company that’s built dozens of award-winning prefabricated homes, including the nation’s first LEED Platinum home. LivingHomes now serves as Plant’s Design Studio, so we can provide, for client’s who want this, full service from design through modular construction.

Leveraging LivingHomes's experience with ten factories over the course of eleven years, we’ve learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t. Plant Prefab reflects many lessons and best practices. Major funding was provided by Obvious Ventures, a venture fund that focuses on #worldpositive investments. Our first factory is a 62,000 sf facility in Rialto, California.

4244,SeaTrec,[1-10],seatrec.com/,Energy,"Seattle, WA, USA","Seatrec harvests energy from temperature differences in the environment to power underwater research, industry, and defense.

OCEAN:
Seatrec’s initial focus is a thermal engine to power underwater platforms, vehicles, and sensors in support of ocean research and national defense. Unmanned underwater platforms and vehicles accelerate ocean exploration and facilitate routine monitoring and surveillance – but require a source of electrical power for propulsion, navigation, data collection, and communications. Typically, this power is supplied by toxic and potentially hazardous lithium batteries of which several tons per year are discarded at sea. Seatrec has developed and patented a compact, modular thermal engine that extracts energy from the ocean’s vertical temperature gradient and converts it to electricity.

Seatrec’s first product, the SL1 Thermal Engine, will support the family of 4000+ expendable, vertically-profiling robotic probes currently deployed in the global ocean as part of an international observing network. The SL1 can dramatically extend the operating lifetime of a profiling float — or enhance its utility through increased profiling rates and support of energy-intensive sensors for biogeochemical and acoustical studies. Variants of this system are currently being developed for integration with underwater gliders, moored profilers, and other high-endurance undersea platforms.

ICE:
Persistent observing systems are required to probe the coupled dynamics of atmosphere, ocean, and ice and associated biogeochemical and ecosystem processes in the pristine polar maritime environment. As in the ocean, lithium-chemistry batteries limit endurance and are associated with high operational costs, safety hazards and negative environmental impacts. In many circumstances neither wind nor solar are viable options for high-latitude applications due to contamination by snow and ice and by the inevitable darkness of polar winter.

Seatrec is developing a novel environmental energy harvesting system that extracts thermal energy from the high-latitude air-sea temperature differential and converts it to clean, useful electricity (patent pending). This effort will result in a clean energy source that could fundamentally alter the logistics and economics of polar observing system operations. The air-sea thermal engine will support oceanographic and meteorological monitoring stations and buoys, navigational beacons, communication nodes, ice-based sensor packages, and satellite-to-acoustic data relays. The system will be compact, low-maintenance and capable of long-term deployment on a fixed platform, buoy, or ice floe – or on a mobile platform such as a drifting buoy or autonomous surface vehicle.

LAND:
Temperature differences on land occur in many forms, both temporal and spatial. Where permanent solar arrays or wind turbines are not appropriate, the diurnal (day-night) temperature differential at a specific location can be utilized to generate power for applications ranging from backcountry recreation to remote communications facilities to covert surveillance and border security. Terrestrial applications exploiting vertical temperature differences between the air, earth, and groundwater are also being explored to support residential, industrial, and defense energy requirements in remote, off-grid locations."

NanoGraf Technologies has demonstrated a novel high energy density Si-based anode material that has the long-term potential to replace graphite based anodes in lithium-ion batteries for a range of applications, from consumer electronics to electric vehicles.

We patented a low cost manufacturing process already proven at the multi-ton scale.
NanoGraf’s proprietary manufacturing process is differentiated from competitors relying on expensive and complex vapor deposition-based systems. Instead, we utilize a wet chemistry process that is highly scalable and already proven in a multi ton-scale pilot manufacturing line in Japan.

Our anode materials drop in to existing electrode mixing and coating equipment, and they have been validated in large scale battery manufacturing facilities worldwide.

Our silicon-graphene anode materials enable longer lasting, faster charging batteries.
NanoGraf technology was developed, optimized, and patented by our team working in collaboration with researchers at Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory.

SiNode’s technology utilizes a proprietary silicon alloy-graphene material architecture to achieve category-leading performance and solutions to long-standing Si anode technical hurdles. The proprietary combination of silicon-based alloys and a flexible 3D graphene network helps stabilize the active material during charge and discharge.

Whereas current graphite-based anodes offer a capacity of 372 mAh/g, NanoGraf material can be customized to achieve capacities between 1000 mAh/g and over 2500 mAh/g, delivering higher cell level energy density and best-in-class rate capabilities for high discharge applications.

Current battery technology cannot meet the energy and power demands of today’s on-the-go consumer.
Over the past two decades lithium-ion batteries have become the primary technology powering the rapid growth of portable electronics and more recently electric vehicles. However, current battery chemistries have hit a plateau in performance improvements and are unable to meet consumer demand for ever increasing range, power, and cycling stability.

Trevi System's has developed an innovative and highly efficient Forward Osmosis (FO) process, in order to produce clean water from saltwater, brackish water, or industrial wastewater at a much lower cost and energy use as compared to Reverse Osmosis (RO) technologies. Rather than force water through a membrane as in RO systems, FO relies on osmotic pressure to draw water across the membrane. In the FO system, the “feed” solution or contaminated water is pumped to one side of the semi-permeable membrane. The “draw” solution, which has a high concentration of a specially designed chemical and a low concentration of water relative to the feed solution, is pumped to the other side of the membrane. The water molecules are attracted or pulled through the membrane via osmotic pressure – that is, the water molecules want to migrate from an area of high water concentration to one of low water concentration. Accordingly, water is pulled through the membrane using no energy, leaving the salts or other contaminates on the opposite side.

The benefits of the Trevi FO system are numerous:

•The system requires only a small fraction, of the electrical energy of current RO systems.

•The system uses relatively low cost waste heat or low temperature heat to separate the draw chemical from the clean water.

•The system can be customized to work under specific water conditions such as seawater, brackish water, municipal wastewater, or industrial wastewater.

•When used for desalination, the system can also be customized to produce brine streams of varying salt concentrations depending on the environmental requirements of the location.

•The system operates at ambient pressure, avoiding the extra costs of the high pressure stainless steel plumbing required by RO systems, and the need for expensive high pressure pumps."

When she saw her first jackfruit at a street vendor’s stall, she was immediately intrigued. Why had she never heard of this huge, green, oddly studded fruit that was a dietary staple here in South and Southeast Asia? She set out to learn more, and what she learned was this: despite its many nutritional and ecological benefits, the majority of jackfruit grown in India was going to waste.

The jackfruit tree is wholly adapted to its environment—resistant to high temperatures, drought, and easy to grow. And because it doesn’t need to be replanted each year, it’s more viable for farmers to plant additional trees for future investment in their supply chain.

Not only that, jackfruit itself is nutritionally dense. It’s high in sustaining fiber, low in calories, and has a meaty, firm texture and versatile flavor. All put together, Annie realized that jackfruit had potential that matched its size—to not only improve our diets and health, but also the livelihood of local farmers, and ultimately, the well-being, of our planet.

But despite its local popularity and the abundant production, a virtually non-existent international supply system meant the majority of this miracle food was left unsold and uneaten."

Its patented technology is a game-changer in the wind energy sector; it uses 90% less material while being twice as efficient than existing technology. Unlike conventional wind turbines, the Kitepower system does not require resource-intensive towers or heavy foundations and is thus easy to transport and deploy. The system is able to harness stronger and more persistent winds at higher altitudes, allowing for capacity factors greater than 0.5 and in return cost-effective electricity generation, this opens up new geographical markets for the generation of wind energy. The 100kW system currently in development is ideally suited to replace diesel generator sets in remote locations to save costs and mitigate dependency on diesel supply.
Kitepower was founded by Johannes Peschel and Roland Schmehl in January 2016 as a result of the work done by TU Delft’s pioneering kite power research group of the former astronaut Wubbo Ockels. Already in 2007, the first 20kW Kitepower system demonstrated the proof of concept. The 100kW system Kitepower is currently developing will be one of the first airborne wind energy systems available on the market.

We make grants across the US, with a predominant focus on the Southeast, a 10-state region responsible for nearly a third of US emissions.
HOW WE WORK:
In consultation and partnerships with advisors rooted in philanthropy and community activism, and with lived experience in the South, we identify and build relationships with groups and leaders who have historically lacked access to funding and who are essential to making progress to address the climate crisis. We fund grantee partners with significant amounts of multi-year general support funding and trust in their expertise.
The Hive Fund also provides a range of grant-making services to donors, including fostering a learning community with other funders to explore strategies to address systemic funding barriers and maximize benefit to grantees. We’re not afraid to experiment with new approaches, and we’re committed to being honest and transparent about what’s working and what’s not.
OUR APPROACH:
White supremacy, misogyny, and economic systems that make pollution profitable are intimately intertwined. Addressing the climate crisis at a scale and in the time needed to avert disaster will require transforming the systems of power governing who pollutes, who profits, and whose lives are valued. Many Black, Brown, and Indigenous women have been fighting fossil industries for years, even generations. These leaders are skilled, sophisticated, and visionary campaigners for justice, and among the most energized champions of climate action. Many of their organizations work by multi-solving - building civic power and addressing many problems affecting our communities at once. Yet these groups receive only a tiny share of philanthropic funding.
Funding for women of color-led efforts and multi-solving approaches can speed up the transition to a fossil-free society that also values women’s lives and leadership and delivers cleaner air, voting rights, living wage jobs, and other tangible and lasting benefits. Philanthropic investments will help organizations consolidate wins and expand power in virtuous cycles as people see the fruits of their efforts in tangible improvements in their lives and communities. These victories begin to scale into transformational and gigaton-level change."

Our primary goal is to address the acute financing gap in early-stage climate-related innovation which currently prevents breakthrough technology companies from addressing climate change at scale. While venture capital (VC) is well-positioned to support capital-light innovation (e.g. software or connected/smart devices), it is not well-suited to support transformative hardware-based innovation in infrastructure-heavy categories relevant to massive greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. Catalytic capital is patient, risk-tolerant, and flexible in ways that differ from conventional capital. It is a critical but under-utilized tool to support the primary population Prime serves: nascent hardware-based companies poised to address climate change. Its potential is to close the critical funding gap, and crowd in billions of dollars of growth capital not active in this space by “de-risking” these companies early on. Prime’s investments diverge from traditional VC in corporate form, appetite for disproportionate risk/reward and longer time horizons, management incentives, and investment criteria prioritization, where climate impact is paramount. Whether it be through traditional grants, recoverable grants, program-related investments, or mission-related investments, catalytic capital can support Prime ensures that all catalytic capital is invested according to our core investment criteria: Gigaton-scale impact: Only invest in companies with potential to reduce GHG emissions at the gigaton scale annually by 2050. 2. Additionality: Only place capital where we can demonstrate investment would not be made “but for” Prime’s intervention. 3. Attractive to follow-on funders: Only invest in companies attractive to conventional investors in subsequent rounds, after initial risk is retired via catalytic capital support."

Climate Outreach was set up in 2004, with a mission to help people understand climate change in their own voice, and we’ve become Europe’s leading climate communication organisation.
We produce world-leading advice and practical tools for engagement by combining scientific research methods with years of hands-on experience. Our services support governments, businesses, NGOs and grassroots organisations. We specialise in how to engage hard-to-reach audiences – developing climate connection programmes with communities such as youth, the centre-right, faith and migrant groups.
In our decade as leaders in climate change communication we’ve seen it all: the photographs of sad polar bears, the complicated graphs, the science speak, the doom and gloom omens of the apocalypse, and the wailed laments of “won’t somebody please think of the future of the planet?!”.
Our rigorous research has shown us that these messages simply aren’t effective for the majority of people. Worse than that, they can be disempowering. These stories make many people turn away, because climate change is seen as a niche concern, a complex scientific problem, an issue for the future only, and something that makes us fearful.
Climate change demands a response across society, from people of all ages, faiths, nationalities and sides of the political spectrum. That’s why our mission is to engage people with climate change from their perspective – not ours.

That’s why we engage, listen to, and work with people and organisations from across our global society. We specialise in communicating climate change in ways that are inclusive and people-focused, appealing to common values and goals to unite us in a shared mission.

Founded in 2009, the Institute has trained over 14,000 farmers, ranchers, and pastoralists and influenced management of nearly 16 Million hectares of grasslands through the adoption of Holistic Planned Grazing – a process that mimics ancestral grazing patterns of wild herbivores that co-evolved with healthy grassland ecosystems. Developed by Allan Savory in the 1960’s, Holistic Management (HM) has been proven in a wide variety of contexts to regenerate grasslands, build soil, increase biodiversity, and sequester significant amounts of carbon while also improving social and economic outcomes.The Savory Global Network is comprised of regionally-based Savory Hubs (learning centers), Accredited Professionals (field educators), and Regenerating Members (recurring monthly donors) which together are our scale-up mechanism for increasing adoption. Savory Hubs are all locally owned and locally operated training centers that, through Accredited Professionals, provide HM training, resources, and implementation support to local farmers and ranchers. With an intimate knowledge of local culture, economy, policies, and environment, Hubs are able to mentor producers and help them implement these regenerative management practices in a contextually-specific manner that is relevant to their region.Savory’s Land to Market program, supported by the robust metrics of the Ecological Outcome Verification protocol, connects conscientious buyers, brands, and retailers directly to farms and ranches verified to be regenerating their land, creating the world’s first and only outcomes-based verified regenerative sourcing solution for the food and fiber industries. IMPACT TO DATEThe Savory Global Network currently operates across six continents training, equipping, and mentoring roughly 10 new Hubs per year. Since 2009, we have achieved the following impact:51 Global Hubs148 Accredited Professionals14,068 farmers/ranchers/pastoralists trained 15.9 million hectares of land holistically managedIn addition, Savory Institute periodically engages with municipalities, governments, and other NGO’s to collaborate on multi-year projects that build capacity within those organizations to scale the use of regenerative land management practices. Examples of special projects include joint efforts with Heifer International in Senegal, with The Nature Conservancy in Colorado, and with ADRA in Mongolia.Savory’s big audacious goal for 2025 is to influence management on 1 billion hectares of land and make a significant dent in carbon drawdown before it is too late.

The energy industry in Britain is ruled by a handful of complacent dinosaurs peddling fossil fuels, pricing trickery and poor customer service. In 2016, Octopus entered the market to disrupt the status quo with energy that's good for the planet, good for your wallet, and, honestly, good for your soul.
Since then, we've been picking up 30,000 customers a month on average, and now supply energy to 1.5 million UK homes (and counting). To this day, 92% of our customers rate us as 5* Excellent on TrustPilot; and we’re the only supplier to be recommended by consumer champion, Which? year after year after year..
Why?
We work for you
We do things differently. Our prices are fair and transparent, and we don't lock you into a contract, so you can leave at any time. In fact, we try to make everything as easy as possible for you, from the simplicity of our bills to offering customer service over email and social media at times that suit you — 8am‐10pm, 7 days a week.
The better choice, whether it's for your home, or your business
We provide an easy, affordable energy option for Great Britain's visionary businesses. Whether you're one of the world's biggest football clubs or selling magic wands in Brighton, we'll supply your business with power from the sun.
We work with amazing brands like Arsenal FC and Marks & Spencer, helping legendary UK institutions lead the charge on sustainability nationwide.
Renewable energy as standard
We want to make the eco‐friendly choice the easy choice, so all of our tariffs use 100% green electricity — and they're no more expensive than our competitors' non‐green tariffs. You can also carbon offset the gas you use if you want to minimise your environmental impact even further.
And we make sure today's renewables infrastructure keeps on turning, generating clean, green energy to power Great Britain. We're backed by Octopus Investments, the UK's largest investor in solar power, responsible for nearly 40% of the nation's large scale solar generation.
Energy fit for the future
While we look after your energy supply today, we're also building technology that will define the industry's future, from the big ideas to the small.
In 2017, we launched Octopus Tracker, a UK‐first tariff championing price transparency like never before, offering fair daily rates based on the wholesale price of energy.
Then, in 2018, we became the only supplier to really harness the potential of smart meter technology with Agile Octopus, a time of use tariff with half‐hourly rates allowing customers to adjust their consumption to times when the wholesale price of energy is cheapest.
Next came Octopus Go, a tariff designed just for EV drivers, with a super cheap night rate so these early adopters of the future of green transport can always wake up fully charged.
And it's not just about your home energy: Octopus Electric Vehicles is helping GB drivers switch to greener cars, providing everything from the car itself to smart charging options. We're getting our world ready for this electric revolution with Powerloop, an EV leasing bundle introducing vehicle‐to‐grid charging to GB homes. Drivers use their cars to power their homes during times of peak energy demand to relieve pressure on the grid.
So that's a little about us. Want to know more? Check out our blog for more about Octopus Energy."

The mission of the Connecticut Institute for Resilience and Climate Adaptation (CIRCA) is to increase the resilience and sustainability of communities vulnerable to the growing impacts of climate change on the natural, built, and human environments.
About
CIRCA is a multi‐disciplinary, center of excellence that brings together experts in the natural sciences, engineering, economics, political science, finance, and law to provide practical solutions to problems arising as a result of a changing climate. The Institute will help coastal and inland floodplain communities in Connecticut and throughout the Northeast better adapt to changes in climate and also make their human‐built infrastructure more resilient while protecting valuable ecosystems and the services they offer to human society (food, clean air and water, and energy). The Institute will combine the world‐class research capabilities of UConn and the progressive policies and practical regulatory experience of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP) to translate sound scientific research to actions that can ensure the resilience and sustainability of both the built and natural environments of the coast and watersheds of Connecticut.
While Connecticut and the Northeast are particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change and associated severe weather events, the problem exists at the national and international scales, with droughts and flooding worldwide. Severe storms in the United States cause 110 deaths per year in flood-related accidents and an average of $3.8 billion annually in property damage. In addition to floods, droughts, pollution of water resources and coastal areas, ocean currents and severe weather (ice/snow/hail storms, hurricanes, etc.) are the most costly and deadly of all natural disasters. Climate change affects the water cycle increasing the frequency of abnormal weather, including heavy rains and droughts, around the world with particularly severe impacts in developing countries. While its immediate attention will be in Connecticut and the Northeast, the Institute will develop comprehensive approaches to climate change research and its impacts at the national and international scales.
In collaboration with local, regional, and national partners, the Institute’s multi‐disciplinary research, outreach, and education programs will strive to:

Improve scientific understanding of the changing climate system and its local and regional impacts on coastal and inland floodplain communities;
Develop and deploy natural science, engineering, legal, financial, and policy best practices for climate resilience;
Undertake or oversee pilot projects designed to improve resilience and sustainability of the natural and built environment along Connecticut’s coast and inland waterways;
Create a climate‐literate public that understands its vulnerabilities to a changing climate and which uses that knowledge to make scientifically informed, environmentally sound decisions;
Foster resilient and sustainable communities – particularly along the Connecticut coastline and inland waterways – that can adapt to the impacts and hazards of climate change; and
Reduce the loss of life and property, natural system and ecological damage, and social disruption from high‐impact events.

Anticipating that society will eventually establish policies and markets that compensate verifiable reductions in atmospheric carbon or their equivalent contributing to global climate change, the CC Lab will develop carbon containment solutions that can serve to fulfill those demands.
The CC Lab focuses on adapting and managing natural systems involved in sequestering carbon. It will design and test approaches modeled after natural processes, such as peat formation, that limit decomposition in the photosynthetic carbon cycle and ultimately concentrate and store carbon from plant matter underground or underwater. The CC Lab is also exploring opportunities to reduce natural methane emissions, and capturing carbon with rock weathering and petrification.
Yale’s programmatic strengths in economics, law, architecture, and health policy help guide project development to ensure effective and safe deployment of approaches and resources. Operating as part of the Yale School of the Environment, the CC Lab draws on the exceptional expertise and skill of Yale University faculty as well as the extraordinary talent and commitment of Yale alumni, students and staff.

Our Mission
The climate crisis stems largely from a misalignment of incentives. Polluters don’t pay for their emissions. The voluntary carbon credit market is changing this, enabling companies to offset their emissions by paying projects to capture carbon. Today, this market is highly wasteful due to a lack of liquid markets, forcing projects to go through layers of financial middlemen that extract the majority of money from credits.
Toucan is enabling a web3 regenerative finance ecosystem, by bridging carbon credits into crypto and pooling them in standardized categories. We have created the first globally accessible and liquid market for voluntary carbon credits. Working with top DeFi protocols and the community we enable carbon credits to be used as collateral, yields and money, as well as a huge range of novel applications.
In the first week, our Base Carbon Tonne did 845m$ in volume and we bridged 10m tonnes of CO2, equivalent to the emissions of Costa Rica. We are just getting started, and need top talent that want maximum leverage in solving the climate crisis."

Present-day industrial hydrogen is itself a sector in dire need of decarbonization. Zero-CO2 hydrogen -- whether produced from water via electrolysis, or from water and natural gas via CCUS-instrumented steam reforming -- is too costly and impractical, especially when intended to replace the cheap fossil fuels as a source of industrial heat. 
At H Quest, we have developed an efficient, electrically powered hydrogen source based on microwave plasma, with the energy requirement 4 times lower than water electrolysis. The zero-CO2 hydrogen is a by-product of conversion of natural gas, while the high-value product slate is highly tunable and ranges from crumpled graphene sheets to high-structure carbon blacks to platform chemicals.

Throughout the majority of history, our species has evolved living active lifestyles and consuming a Hunter and Gatherer diet rich in high quality meat, wholesome vegetables, fruit, nuts and seeds. On the contrary, modern day diets of processed foods and excessive sugar, combined with sedentary lifestyles have pushed our physiologies dangerously far from their adapted environments. By looking to the diets and lifestyles of our ancestors, we believe that evolution has much to teach us about human optimization and healthful living. EPIC products are an expression of our evolutionary biology, and allow modern day omnivores to thrive consuming a wide array of nature's bounties; just as mother nature intended.ANIMALS:EPIC foods begin with a living animal. We believe that all ruminants should consume diets they were biologically intended to eat and roam freely outdoors. As a result our beef, venison, wild boar, lamb, and bison are raised on open pasture just how nature intended. We continuously strive to convert ranchers to this pasture based livestock model, and through our products, create financial incentives to help change American agriculture. Through our sourcing, we support organizations devoted to improving animal welfare standards. Our key allies are The Savory Institute, The Global Animal Partnership, The Certified Humane Project, and The Marine Stewardship Council.LANDS:Through our partnership with The Savory Institute, EPIC is committed to global large-scale grassland restoration efforts. We believe that ranchers who operate within a holistic context are positioned to create incredibly positive impacts on their local ecosystems as well as the world at large. When managed appropriately, animals can enrich the earth by aerating the ground, fertilizing the soil, and positively shaping landscapes. Through these biodynamic ranching practices, we are learning that healthy lands create wonderful habitats for native and migratory animals, effectively hold ground water, build topsoil, and sequester carbon from the atmosphere!TASTE:We call our company EPIC in honor of the great-tasting products we make. Our flavors are diverse and based on the unique tastes of our animals. Each product is further complemented by adding dried fruit, nuts, seeds, and creative spice blends. The end result is flavor-forward, delicious, meat- and egg white-based protein snacks that taste EPIC."

Accelerating a Natural Process
Project Vesta’s approach dramatically accelerates this ancient natural process. We make green-sand beaches with an abundant volcanic mineral, olivine. There, wave action speeds up the carbon dioxide capture process while de-acidifying the ocean. Thirty years of scientific research has demonstrated that this works and has provided strong evidence that it is a highly affordable and scalable solution. The process captures 20 times more carbon dioxide than the extraction and transportation of the olivine. If deployed on just 2% of global shelf seas, could capture 100% of annual human emissions.
An Open-Source Scientific Approach
Our mission is to further the science of enhanced weathering and galvanize global deployment. To that end, we are planning experiments to pilot green-sand beaches. All scientists in the field are welcome to contribute to the design of these experiments, and all are welcome to analyze the resulting data. Once we have finished the experiments and published the data, we will be able to deliver to the world a blueprint and integrated model for deploying green sand beaches. The Enhanced Weathering Integrated Assessment Model (EWIAM) will enable any government or private organization to measurably remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at scale."

THE GROUNDWORK BIOAG STORY
Groundwork BioAg’s pioneering production method and innovative inoculants are based on over twenty five years of research at Israel’s prestigious Agricultural Research Organization (ARO). The research was conducted under the auspices of Prof. Yoram Kapulnik, former Managing Director of ARO and the Volcani Center.

Groundwork BioAg was established to build upon this innovation, to scale it to mass production, and to bring it to market. Serial entrepreneurs Yossi Kofman and Dan Grotsky, who were actively seeking such an opportunity at the time, approached Danny Levy, a mycorrhiza production expert originally from Kapulnik’s lab. Together, the three founders set out to revolutionize commercial agriculture with an organism that has existed in nature for over 400 million years.

Indeed, mycorrhizal fungi have been helping plants absorb nutrients long before agriculture even existed. Furthermore, the broad scope of benefits of mycorrhizal symbiosis has been well studied and documented over four decades of research. However, modern agricultural methods, such as tilling, sterilization, and application of fungicides and pesticides, deplete mycorrhiza in today’s farms. Restoration of the soil’s mycorrhizal balance is crucial to plants’ ability to absorb the precious nutrients that farmers work so hard to provide.

GROUNDWORK BIOAG IS GROUNDBREAKING
The innovation that led to Groundwork BioAg’s highly-effective bio-inoculants is nothing less than a game-changer. Previously, mycorrhiza was a luxury product, affordable in low application rates within niche markets only. By producing highly-concentrated and vigorous mycorrhizal inoculants, Groundwork BioAg is able to penetrate mainstream commercial agriculture with effective, high-quality, and affordable products."

Our mission is to bring life back to rivers by creating wildlife habitat for the benefit of people and the environment.AboutRiver Partners connects a bold vision of bringing life back to rivers with the hard, detailed work of rebuilding wild places, creating homes for wildlife, and improving our landscapes for the benefit of future generations.Giving New Life to River LandscapesTwo decades ago, a pair of conservation-minded California farmers had a path-breaking realization: farmers and ecologists could work together to regenerate riparian forests.River Partners pioneered the use of agricultural techniques combined with ecological science to re-introduce critical habitat in California on a scale not undertaken by any other organization. Our practices establish self-sustaining forests from seeds in just three years.Repairing some of the most threatened ecology in the state creates a lifeline for fragile species, and a valuable flood-control alternative to levees and dams.Our work allows riparian areas the full breadth of their natural purpose: nurseries for young salmon, rich habitat for birds, mammals and pollinators, a buffer zone for floodwaters, and a place for people to reconnect with the natural world. Our experience in the field and close connections with communities have taught us that restored floodplains can also provide much more.Proven Solutions: Resilient Ecosystems and CommunitiesSince 1998, River Partners has channeled $125 million toward restoration of 13,500 acres of river corridors throughout California. Every acre we restore yields many times its cost in broad ecological value:* River forests lower flood risk to downstream communities by reducing erosion and allowing floodwaters to slow down and spread out.* Floodwaters sink into the aquifer and contribute to recharge of groundwater.* Young, growing forests have higher rates of carbon sequestration than mature woodlands, reducing the impact of global warming.* Riparian forests act as natural pollution filters to improve water quality.* Reduced agricultural water use conserves freshwater.* Healthy river ecosystems provide habitat for birds, animals, pollinators and enhance fisheries.* Open space on public land creates recreational and educational benefits for surrounding communities.* The majority of our funding is directed to local communities in under-resourced areas, strengthening local economies.The Time Is NowRiparian areas have been called California’s rainforests. They are hotspots in a state with greater biodiversity than most other places on Earth. Our river corridors support more endangered and threatened animals than any other habitat in our state. Yet today, just 5% of California’s native floodplains remain. With drought and flooding projected to become more severe, we can expect riparian ecosystems to bear the brunt of climate extremes, endangering people, property and fragile species.Together with our partners, River Partners has helped California emerge as a world leader in restoration practices that empower communities to regenerate healthy rivers and floodplains. We are now positioned to accelerate the pace of riparian habitat recovery throughout the state."

It is the ""first and only permit ever issued in the U.S. to a nuclear plant using something other than a light water (""water-cooled"") reactor"".[1] It will use ""recycled"" high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel originally fabricated for the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II),[2][3][4] and if fully operational, would become ""the first fuel-recycling commercial reactor in the United States"".[5] The DOE's Idaho National Laboratory (INL) said it would provide 10 tons of HALEU for the test reactor which corresponds to most of the available supply.[6] Reprocessing would occur at INL's Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC) and possibly also the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), neither of which are operational facilities as of early 2020.[7]

The reactor design is a fast-neutron reactor with heat pipe cooling similar to the NASA Kilopower reactor.[3] According to the designers, the reactor will have a ""large negative temperature reactivity coefficient"", lacks pumps and valves, uses heat pipes for heat removal, has no nuclear refueling intervals and associated core exposure, and its core is buried underground.[8] In presenting its safety design to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Oklo quoted a study of the EBR-II, which is a different reactor technology, as being ""inherently protected without requiring emergency power, safety systems, or operator intervention"".[8]

Because we're always on the lookout for the biggest levers, our solutions create opportunities for these people. Being that catalyst maximizes the impact our time and money has on the issue.
⦿ It's getting hot!
Our future is in danger! Not only that: According to the latest climate science, it can already be considered lost. Over the next decades Earth will heat up so much that it will become largely uninhabitable.
⦿ What do do?
The task sounds simple: We must reduce our CO2 emissions. Drastically. Starting in 2020 we need a yearly reduction of more than 6% to stand a chance. Sounds easy? It isn’t!
⦿ We act!
As professionals from startups who are in love with efficiency and scale and engaged climate activists we team up to bring two worlds together. That way we can have measurable impact at scale and thereby rethink climate activism. Of course with fun and not for profit.

Unlike conventional fuel cells, which only run on hydrogen, Sunfire fuel cells can also be operated with different hydrocarbons, such as natural gas, biogas, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and various liquid hydrocarbon fuels (methanol, ethanol, diesel)."

The recently released report from the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) could not be clearer: we are on track to climate disaster, and we have just a decade to avert the worst of it. The report sounds the alarm about the dangers of failing to limit warming to 1.5°C; by contrast, even 2°C of warming places hundreds of millions more people at risk of poverty, doubles the number of people living with water stress, subjects tens of millions more people to devastating heat waves, and more. Warming beyond 2°C  — the path we are currently on — will likely result in catastrophic harm, as global conflicts and mass migration produce unprecedented levels of social, political, and economic disruption. The recent U.S. 4th National Climate Assessment estimated that economic losses due to climate change could double those of the Great Recession of 2008, with hundreds of billions of dollars in damages annually due to heat-related deaths, sea level rise, decreased agricultural productivity, and more. Climate change puts investor assets at unprecedented risk, as experts agree that the effects will be large, negative, and undiversifiable. 

Responsible corporate governance is critical to addressing climate change. 
According to the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC], the only hope of averting climate disaster requires cutting carbon emissions in half across the entire global economy by 2030, and then reaching net-zero emissions worldwide by 2050. To achieve this, corporate boards urgently must become climate competent, ensuring that their business models, investment plans, executive incentives, and policy influence are aligned directly to this target. Climate competent boards are competent, independent, and diverse, capable of leading companies through the complexities our climate challenge requires. Particularly in times of business model transformation, regular refreshment of the board can be important to ensure that the current balance of director experiences and abilities matches the company’s current needs.  

Investors have the power, opportunity, and responsibility to act and hold public companies accountable.
Long-term investors must act to ensure that the companies in which they are invested are aligning themselves to a net-zero carbon future, mitigating risks to shareholders, and taking full advantage of the opportunities economy-wide decarbonization presents.  Indeed, for long-term investors, voting on the election of corporate directors is the single most direct and important action they can take to communicate their views to company leadership and ensure that companies are managing the challenges and opportunities of climate change.  Large investors with significant voting power bear particular responsibility for ensuring that boards are appropriately overseeing and planning for our net-zero carbon future."

We knew we wouldn’t be able to do business as usual to make those changes. So we completely rethought how an energy company should work.    We started with the pricing; buying electricity should be simple and straightforward. We layered in unparalleled customer service because we want the experience of using our energy to be amazing.    Then we focused on what the wonders of today’s technology could add to the process. Connecting smart home devices to the very grid that powers them gives the user complete control over how their lifestyle equates to energy usage. We developed the latest artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to help our customers save money on electricity, reduce their carbon footprint, and stay comfortable.    We’re an electricity company that doesn’t make money on electricity.

New Sky’s SulfurCycle process is the most sustainable and cost effective way to control hydrogen sulfide inside anaerobic digesters or biogas streams. SulfurCycle uses a water based, non-toxic suspension of metal oxide particles to capture and convert H2S into elemental sulfur. The H2S capture agent is regenerated in situ simply by blowing air through spent media, which converts captured sulfide into elemental sulfur. Media can be reused up to 30 times; significantly reducing chemical purchasing and waste disposal costs relative to conventional single use scavengers.

By recirculating treated gas to digesters operators can control H2S levels inside digesters by treating biogas outside digesters. This dramatically reduces the need to use iron salts or other chemical additives for H2S control."

(""Ocean-based""​) is focused on leveraging and amplifying the ocean's natural countermeasures to climate change. The oceans cover 70% of earth's surface, and absorb up to 50% of excess CO2 from fossil fuel emissions. But recent studies suggest this natural carbon sink is declining due to warming.

Our suite of ocean technologies can help restore and amplify these natural processes without any negative impact on marine ecosystems.

Ocean-based is a privately-held company based in the USA, whose parent company Atmocean, Inc. (www.atmocean.com) was founded in 2006. It was recognized as a wave energy leader in 2012 by Sandia National Laboratories; awarded grants from Oregon Wave Energy Trust and the UK Technology Strategies Board; since 2006 conducted over 100 days of ocean testing offshore Texas, California, Oregon, Hawaii, Peru, and Newfoundland Canada; and performed wave tank testing at Plymouth University (UK), and Texas A&M University.

This year, Ocean-based is pleased to introduce its Corporate Gigaton Challenge as an alternative financing mechanism to remove CO2. The target is one gigaton of cumulative CO2 removed within 15 years, using technologies provided by Ocean-based.

Under this program, multi-national corporations fund the deployment of CO2-removal technologies by issuing common stock rather than paying in cash. Rather than reduce corporate earnings, this program expands the number of shares issued, with the corporate market capitalization recovered as investors allocate more funds to public companies with higher ""ESG""​ profiles. With higher market cap, the net result is the company eliminates its CO2 footprint at zero or even ""negative""​ cost."

The average price of gas in the US was $1.84/gallon (diesel was $2.27) and electrification for fleet vehicles was in its infancy.  In fact, very few of the companies selling hybrids, plug-in hybrids, or all-electric fleet vehicles in 2009 are still around today.

Founded by MIT engineers and green energy veterans, the company was on a mission to provide simple, sustainable electrification solutions to the commercial fleet market – a previously untapped space with a large number of vehicles with low mileage and high emissions.

Nearly a decade later, that mission continues.  XL has become the undisputed leader in fleet electrification solutions for Class 2-6 commercial and municipal vehicles.  With thousands of XL-equipped vehicles on the road, approaching 100 million cumulative miles in operation, we have helped save our customers well over 1 million gallons of fuel and eliminated over 13,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

Best of all, we’re just getting started.  We hope you’ll be part of our next decade of success, as we continue our mission to help our fleet customers save money, improve driver productivity and make a positive impact on our environment and the world around us."

Founded in 1974, Oregon Wild (formerly the Oregon Natural Resources Council or ONRC) has been instrumental in securing permanent legislative protection for some of Oregon's most precious landscapes, including nearly 1.7 million acres of Wilderness, 95,000 acres of forests in Bull Run/Little Sandy watersheds (to safeguard the quality of Portland's water supply) and almost 1,800 miles of Wild & Scenic Rivers.
As a leader in the national grassroots campaign for conservation of roadless areas in our national forests, Oregon Wild helped secure administrative protections for more than 58 million acres of spectacular roadless areas across the country.
Our wilderness, old-growth forest and clean rivers/watersheds programs protect pristine drinking water, unparalleled recreation opportunities and fish and wildlife habitat across Oregon. With a staff of 14, including regional coordinators, Oregon Wild's strength is its active grassroots citizen network. Through the power of 3,000 members, over 20,000 e-mail activists and dozens of active volunteers, Oregon Wild works to maintain environmental laws, while building broad community support for our campaigns.

281564,Climate Bonds,[51-100],https://www.climatebonds.net/,"Funding, Capital","Wales, UK","We promote investment in projects and assets necessary for a rapid transition to a low carbon and climate resilient economy.
The strategy is to develop a large and liquid Green and Climate Bonds Market that will help drive down the cost of capital for climate projects in developed and emerging markets; to grow aggregation mechanisms for fragmented sectors; and to support governments seeking to tap debt capital markets.
Climate Bonds Initiative is an investor-focused not-for-profit. Our work therefore is an open source public good and falls into three workstreams.
 
1. Market intelligence


Reporting on green bond market evolution


We produce a Green bonds: State of the Market report, quarterly highlights reports, regional and country-specific reports and updates. We track post-issuance reporting and green bond pricing in the primary market, green bond underwriter league tables and stock exchanges with green/sustainability bond segments. We issue thematic reports, e.g. on sectors and structures used in the market. We also produce guides to facilitate issuance.
A core network development is the Market blog, designed as both a journal of record for bond issuance and updates on investment news and research material to fixed income investment in climate solutions. We maintain a bond library for new issuers since early 2018.
 


Sizing the climate bonds universe


To overcome the perception of a niche market and demonstrate the opportunities available to investors, the Climate Bonds Initiative undertakes an annual survey of bonds outstanding globally related to climate change. The 2018 report showed US$1.45tn outstanding (including US$389bn of green bonds). Each year the report is presented in seminars in multiple countries and via briefings for banks and investors.
 


Demonstrating green infrastructure pipelines


Green infrastructure presents a huge investment opportunity globally, with an estimated US$100tn worth of climate-compatible infrastructure required between now and 2030 in order to meet Paris Agreement emissions reduction targets. The Green Infrastructure Investment Opportunity (GIIO) programme aims to identify and demonstrate green infrastructure investment opportunities around the world. We have published GIIO reports on Indonesia and Australia & New Zealand.

2. Developing a trusted standard 
The Climate Bonds Standard and Certification Scheme is a FairTrade-like labeling scheme for bonds. It is designed as an easy-to-use tool for investors and governments that assists them in prioritising investments that truly contribute to addressing climate change. The Standard is a public good resource for the market.


Climate Bonds Taxonomy is the backbone of the standard work – it defines investments that are part of low carbon economy.


The Climate Bonds Standard is overseen by a Board representing $32 billion of assets under management
...Read more on the Standard
 
3. Providing policy models and advice
Rapid change at very large scale will depend on a close working relationship between government, finance and industry. The Climate Bonds Initiative is developing policy proposals for all three sectors, including:


How to boost bank lending to renewables by adapting the $3 trillion covered bonds market to create renewable energy covered bonds.


Delivering on the promise of large-scale energy efficiency (e.g. getting to 85% of housing stock within 10 years).


Policy risk insurance for renewable energy bonds, to be provided by a consortium of governments.

Our mission is to help governments, businesses, and financial institutions drive growth while addressing climate risk.
 
Our Focus
With international expertise in finance and policy, Climate Policy Initiative’s climate finance division helps governments, businesses, and financial institutions drive economic growth while addressing climate change. The program, which is led by Dr. Barbara Buchner, works to drive low carbon, resilient investment at scale.
Our program areas form a stepping stone approach to reaching this goal:

The State of Climate Finance – CPI is the leading authority on tracking and analyzing climate finance flows. The Global Landscape of Climate Finance is the most comprehensive inventory of climate change investment available. It is a key tool for policy makers to assess the scale of finance, identify the main actors in the market, reveal investment gaps, and highlight opportunities to mobilize finance to fulfill investment potential. Our work influenced the Paris Agreement, and continues to be used by the UNFCCC. CPI’s robust methodology has also been applied at a national and sectoral level to support the governments of India, Indonesia, and Cote d’Ivoire, as well as by SEforAll to assess progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal to improve access to energy, and by IRENA to track renewable energy investment globally.
Effective Finance – CPI advises governments and development finance institutions on the effectiveness of their portfolios, including the UK government’s Department for International Development, the Climate Investment Funds, and the Ministry of Finance in Indonesia. CPI also works to improve public finance interventions in key regions, such as India and Indonesia. For example, in India, we have worked with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Ministry of Finance to illuminate issues around the cost of capital and revise low-cost debt policies.
Transformative Finance – CPI supports the implementation of new and transformative finance solutions that mobilize sustainable investment at scale. CPI manages the Lab: a high-level group of public and private investors that identifies, develops, and supports pilots of transformative climate finance instruments. Since its start in 2014, the 26 investment vehicles incubated and launched by the Lab have collectively mobilized over $1 billion in finance for renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture, water, and climate resilience projects around the world. The Lab has been endorsed by the governments of India, Brazil, and the G7. CPI’s work managing the Lab was also selected in the top 11 “Best Bets” out of nearly 2000 applicants to the MacArthur 100&Change award. In addition to the Lab, CPI manages USICEF, India’s first project preparation facility for distributed renewable energy, and leads GNI+, a partnership between CPI, Baker McKenzie, and AECOM to provide governments with the best available policy, technical, financial, governance, and legal expertise to support their climate goals.

Gopal Farm is founded by Nimai and Ashley. Located on the fertile flood plains of the Wallkill River, we have two farms in the Hudson Valley - a 75-acre Vegetable focused farm in the town of New Paltz, NY, and a 200-acre dairy and education farm in nearby Poughkeepsie, NY. We are dedicated to practicing agriculture in a way that heals and restores to health ancient seeds, our soil, our land, and our human and natural communities. We also have the largest farm on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, the largest Coconut farm in the continental USA in Pine Island off the coast of Florirda as well as a Mango farm. 
We are focused on growing heirloom Indian ethnic specialty vegetables, tropical fruits, spices, and Ayurvedic herbs many of them sourced from seeds harvested from different regions of India including from the foothills of the Himalayas. Our produce thus retains the distinctive aromas, flavors, and health attributes for which Indian herbs, vegetables, and spices are renowned worldwide. Thereby we hope to preserve many ancient varieties while they are becoming obsolete even in India.
From the summer of 2022, we will be producing Ethical milk products sourced from our herd of A2/A2 grass-fed dairy cows. Our raw milk is to be sold directly from the farm in Poughkeepsie NY, and the VAT pasteurized milk, yogurt, ghee, and other Ethical milk products are to be sold from our booth at Union Square Farmer’s Market as well as to our CSA members around the Northeast whom we deliver in our own refrigerated vehicles as by UPS. We sell our products to gourmet New York City restaurants. Cows are an integral part of our community.

As crazy or mundane as it may sound, our plan to do that starts with ranching – yes, cows eating grass. Without cows eating grass, the sun still shines and the rain still falls, but the first layer of farming – the soil – doesn’t work. Without something growing there to catch it, the sun just bounces back as heat and the rain runs down stream. Of course, without soil, the grass has nowhere to stand to catch the sun and the rain. But what many don’t know is that cows eating grass – done differently and naturally – allows the soil to catch and hold more sunshine and rainfall. Catching more sunshine and rainfall enables us to grow more grass that feeds more cows, or more and better food of any kind. Better soil also cleans our air and rivers, and reinvigorates vibrant wildlife and ecosystems. Better soil is thus the foundation of healthy communities in both the countryside and our cities. We believe that reinventing agriculture – perhaps surprisingly – starts with grass and cows, and focuses first and foremost on regrowing soil. From that start, all else can follow."

Temperatures below the surface can reach 4,200Â° C, decreasing to 650 - 1200Â° at depths of 80km-100km. Through the deep circulation of groundwater and the intrusion of molten magma into the earth's crust at depths of only 1km-5km, the heat is brought closer to the earth's surface. The molten rock then heats the surrounding groundwater, which is forced to the surface in certain areas in the form of steam or hot water (i.e. hot springs, geysers).

Thought for Food




Here’s the deal: One-third of the world’s food goes to waste. Which means all the water, energy and greenhouse gases used to produce that food are wasted with it, making the food industry one of the biggest contributors to climate change.
This is an issue with a $990 billion price tag for the food industry and an even bigger one for the planet. And with the world population expected to grow to 10 billion people by mid-century, the costs will only increase. It’s an insanely complex problem, but we believe the solution is simple Economics 101: supply and demand.


 
What if we could eliminate waste by better balancing the supply and demand of food? 






On-demand delivery is changing the landscape for food brands, creating a massive opportunity: data. Zume uses real-time food consumption data and predictive analytics to help food companies better predict demand, connect it with production and drive better resource decisions down the food supply chain.
Our technology harnesses that data and gives it purpose by allowing any food company to tap into our infrastructure. We call it a sustainability fabric, because it weaves all the pieces of the food system together in a way that’s better for business and our planet.








Here’s how it works
 Zume Forward makes this data actionable, with mobile kitchens, connected appliances and predictive analytics that enable food brands to expand operations closer to customer demand and use resources more efficiently.

Zume Source brings data to the supply chain, creating smarter and more sustainable methods for how food is grown, produced and delivered, including 100% compostable fiber-molded packaging that, at scale, is more affordable than paper or plastic.
And Zume Culinary ensures that quality never suffers by elevating hospitality throughout the delivery experience with menu design, advanced commissary techniques and process automation.
Zume is creating a connected technology infrastructure across the entire food supply chain. We’re hopeful that, together with our partners, we can create better outcomes for businesses and a healthier planet in the process.

The world’s population is expected to grow by over a third, or 2.3 billion people, between 2009 and 2050. This

JUNE 27, 2020 \ IMPROVING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF WATER TREATMENT
The value of magnesium hydroxide as a substitute for caustic soda and lime
Magnesium hydroxide is the least expensive and most powerful alkaline chemical treatment available on the market for pH control applications.

Solving global challenges and contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Calix has identified some key global challenges that have emerged in the last decade and are increasingly putting our planet at risk. By aligning innovation and development initiatives with the SDGs, Calix is driven to make an impactful and meaningful contribution to solving global challenges.

SDG 2: Zero hunger
END HUNGER, ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVED NUTRITION AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE.
To help, Calix is developing BOOSTER-Mag to increase yields, while making crop protection safer.

Target 2.4 – By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaption to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality.

To help, Calix has developed BOOSTER-Mag to make crop protection safer. BOOSTER-Mag is a broad spectrum, effective anti-fungal, anti-pest fertiliser that’s safe to use and overcomes many of the problems around both pesticides and biopesticides, on average at a far lower cost.

SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation
ENSURE AVAILABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF WATER AND SANITATION FOR ALL.
To help, Calix is developing safe, sustainable solutions to prevent odour, protect existing and new sewer infrastructure, while improving wastewater treatment performance.

Target 6.3 – By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.

To help, Calix has developed ACTI-Mag Magnesium Hydroxide Mg(OH)2, a safe and more earth-friendly alternative to caustic soda for wastewater treatment across industries including municipalities, agriculture, and food manufacturing. It lets industries control pH and alkalinity in wastewater for odour control, and address significant issues such as phosphate or fats, oils, and greases.

WATERAID
Transforming lives through safe water, sanitation and hygiene education
Calix supports WaterAid programs to facilitate access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene in the world’s poorest and most marginalised communities.

This partnership with WaterAid aligns perfectly with our purpose and the reason why we exist, “We Solve Global Challenges” and with our core value of “positive impact”.

Improving the sustainability of water treatment
Calix is developing safe, sustainable solutions to prevent odour, protect existing and new infrastructure, and improve wastewater treatment performance.

SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy
ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SUSTAINABLE AND MODERN ENERGY FOR ALL.
To help, along with our work on bioenergy, Calix is developing high performance, low-cost, fast charge-discharge lithium-ion hybrid batteries based on nano-active electrode materials.

Target 7.2 – BY 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.

To help, Calix is developing high performance, affordable, and more recyclable lithium-ion hybrid batteries based on nano-active electrode materials produced by its new BATMn reactor in Australia.

In another approach to developing clean, affordable energy sources, Calix’s ACTI-Mag can be used in anaerobic digesters to help convert wastewater into energy while reducing struvite.

SDG 13: Climate action
TAKE URGENT ACTION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS.
To help, Calix’s technology is being developed and adapted to reduce CO2 emissions in cement, lime, and hydrogen production.

For example, Calix’s technology is being used to reduce CO2 emissions in cement, lime, and hydrogen production. For example, Calix is a key participant in LEILAC (Low Emissions Intensity Lime and Cement); a European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation project that will help Europe’s cement and lime industries reduce their CO2 emissions dramatically without significant energy or capital penalty.

Calix is the core technology provider and project leader.

Reducing emissions from the cement industry
Project leilac utilises the Calix Process – a world first patented technology that changes the way limestone is heated. Find out more.

SDG 14: Life below water
SDG 14 FOCUSES ON KEEPING OCEANS SAFE AND CLEAN.
To help, Calix is advancing shrimp and prawn aquaculture with an environmentally friendly water conditioning using AQUA-Cal+.

AQUA-Cal+ is also being developed for freshwater lake and pond remediation.

Aquaculture is seen as a viable way to meet the growing demand for animal products globally with more efficient feed use than cattle or pig farming. However, aquaculture feed and waste produce nitrogen and phosphorus, the build-up of these elements on water beds may lead to negative ecological disruptions. If uncontrolled, the spread of algae could lead to the deaths of many species, and affect the biodiversity of ecosystems.

AQUA-Cal+ is a safe, environmentally friendly source of alkalinity; an important requirement for pond water conditioning.

Its high reactivity and surface area are proven to help prevent the build-up of free ammonia and phosphate, which leads to blue-green algae runaways. AQUA-Cal+ is also formulated with high levels of calcium, an important element for crustacean exoskeletons and fish bone formation.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals
STRENGTHEN THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND REVITALIZE THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
Calix develops its technology via a global network of research and development collaborations, including governments, research institutes and universities, some of world’s largest companies, and a growing customer base and distributor network for its commercialised products and processes.

Calix is a key participant in LEILAC (Low Emissions Intensity Lime and Cement), a European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation project that will help Europe’s cement and lime industries reduce their CO2 emissions dramatically without significant energy or capital penalty.

142303,Forest Trends,[11-50],https://www.forest-trends.org/,"Advocacy or Policy, Carbon Accounting & Offsetting, Ecosystems & Biodiversity, Food, Agriculture, & Land Use","Washington D.C., DC, USA","The fate of our climate is intrinsically tied to the fate of our natural ecosystems. Earth’s forests soak up between 30 and 40 percent of global carbon emissions each year. Oceans absorb another quarter. In the United States, specifically, forests, grasslands, and soils already sequester more than half the amount of carbon that all cars and trucks on US roads emit.
Protecting these carbon-rich ecosystems isn’t optional; it’s a prerequisite for ensuring a habitable Earth for future generations.
We have a long way to go. Deforestation is responsible for around 15 percent of annual CO2 emissions around the world, reducing a significant portion of forests’ carbon storage. And the broader “land use” sector, which includes agriculture, is responsible for roughly 25 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.
While the challenge of cutting those numbers is daunting, the potential climate benefits are huge. Keeping trees standing prevents emissions from their destruction while at the same time bolstering the planet’s storage capacity for carbon, making forests a uniquely powerful weapon against climate change. For example, scientists estimate that halting and reversing tropical deforestation could carry us a quarter of the way toward avoiding catastrophic global warming.Forest Trends’ work on emissions cuts across traditional boundaries to find practical, real-world solutions by bringing new allies to the table. Specifically, we:

Track progress by governments and international institutions toward financing forest protection, particularly through the UN program Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+)
Leverage new combinations of funding – public and private, domestic and international – to scale up forest conservation and “climate-smart” agriculture.
Enlist the help of the private sector, the biggest missing link in the fight against climate change – and how to pay for it.
Promote policies that put natural infrastructure to work helping vulnerable communities adapt to the intensifying effects of a changing climate.

Across the world increased water demand from rapid urbanisation and climate change is placing considerable stress on supplies. Businesses, municipalities and industries are recognizing that water quality and supply cannot be taken for granted. As more recent events have demonstrated, security of supply of fresh water is not only critical for human consumption but also for production and profitability of several industries. Industries and governments are increasingly adopting a strategic approach to water usage and management in order to maximize efficiency and to mitigate the risk of disruption which could arise from shortages and/or changes to quality. The investment opportunities are extraordinary because many new materials and technologies are reshaping the power, water and energy industries to meet increasing demand. Most of this demand is coming from transition economies where growth is rapid. For example, in optimization solutions which address energy efficiency (including up-and-downstream processes in the oil & gas and power sectors) and the substitution that provides reliable low carbon alternatives, significant benefits are currently being generated from incremental advancements in technologies.

The future of energy is one of innovation and technology deployment which results in changes; and changes provide opportunities. They have historically invested in critical points along the value chain in collaboration with their strategic alliance partners in order to deliver credible business solutions in key growth markets.

We're swinging for high-leverage, “low-hanging fruit”, starting with national (+ international!) policy, and ultimately expanding to regional, state, and local climate priorities. We work closely with partner orgs to amplify their climate policy priorities using our unique advocacy action toolkit. Learn more about our values here: climatechangemakers.org/our-values.
 
Volunteers, voters, potential voters, friends, family, neighbors, colleagues, candidates, and policymakers: we’re meeting them all right where they are and asking them to make climate action a greater priority, to lean in more, to be a climate changemaker.

Comprised of former EPA enforcement attorneys, public interest lawyers, analysts, investigators, and community organizers, EIP has three goals:

To illustrate through objective facts and figures how the failure to enforce or implement environmental laws increases pollution and harms public health;
To hold federal and state agencies, as well as individual corporations, accountable for failing to enforce or comply with environmental laws; and
To help local communities obtain the protections of environmental laws.

We act as a watchdog because we have to. State and federal agencies charged with protecting the environment often are squeezed by limited resources and political interference from well-funded lobbyists hired by the industries they are required to regulate. We help level the playing field by giving communities the legal and technical resources they need to claim their rights under environmental laws.
Political influence should play no role when the government decides whether to enforce laws which keep cancer-causing benzene out of the lungs of children, for example, or deadly coal soot particles out of the bloodstreams of the elderly.
We do this by advocating for fair enforcement of environmental laws and regulations; writing and distributing reports and data; taking legal actions against big polluters and government agencies, when necessary; and by teaching communities how to participate in the public process regarding important state and federal environmental decisions."

There is a virtuous cycle between profitability and sustainability in many natural resource industries, especially agriculture. Better soil health, water conservation, and climate resilience often leads to lower costs, increased yields, and price premiums for crops or livestock in the market. To reduce the upfront cost and knowledge barriers to implementing these practices, we are tackling an overlooked part of the operation: back office paperwork and financials. There’s tremendous room for improvement on existing software and time-consuming paperwork shuffling in the farm back office. Over time, we’ll expand beyond agriculture to other natural resource industries: fisheries, forestry, mining, water, energy, and more.To accomplish this mission, Ambrook is building a financial management platform for agriculture, starting with tools that help farmers and ranchers automatically discover and apply to farm assistance (e.g. disaster relief, conservation programs, and climate incentives). We’re launching the first version of our full platform later this year. The founding team of Ambrook will be instrumental in building this product strategy and shaping our company culture."

We developed deep engineering expertise in how to make buildings better for occupants while lowering energy usage, both for existing buildings and new construction. We learned about all the rebates, tax credits, and other financial incentives that improve the financial returns of our solutions. And when we realized that our customers didn’t just want advice, they wanted action, we built a full turnkey construction operation to implement the solutions we recommend. Finally, since energy waste creeps back if no one is watching, we created an energy management service, MoBIUS®, that brings our energy savings and troubleshooting expertise to your operations team.

Our purchases are based on how much carbon you’re aiming to offset. Whether you’re looking to reduce your footprint or get all the way to net zero, we can help you reach your goals quickly. And because we use existing markets, the cost is transparent, and your offset is easily verified. You’ll never be left wondering if your efforts created a real impact or not.

The key challenge therefore is: How can today’s climate, social, and economic justice campaigns embolden, recruit, and commit the numbers of courageous volunteers they need to win using the strategy of nonviolent mass civil resistance? How do they solve what most organizers would call ‘the mother of all organizing challenges?’Primary Hypothesis: We know there are already free and proven individual motivators that campaigns have successfully used to increase recruitment & commitment metrics. Therefore, combining five of the best of such motivators into one mobilizing app should have a cumulative, and possibly synergistic effect. If so, this could take nonviolent civil resistance organizing the biggest leap forward since Gandhi or King, and thereby save Mother Nature and democracy itself.Our Mission: To increase the chance of nonviolent civil resistance-based campaign success to 70-80% by individually and systematically identifying and removing people’s psychological & logistical barriers to participation in such courageous campaigns -- to scale moral courage. Our Software Solution:Moves potential “on the fence” volunteers to committing to more courageous tasks and “resister-support” roles by seamlessly integrating proven and free major psychological drivers (e.g. crowdacting/conditional commitment, individualized barrier removal, motivational videos, peer- bonding) into a one-stop, mobile-friendly, free, highly secure, and open source “courage-building” ladder of engagement.

The Waterfront Alliance began as a project of The Municipal Art Society of New York. It became an independent organization in 2007 when a group of leading activists, businesses, foundations, and civic organizations came together with the goal of making the New York and New Jersey harbor a shared, resilient, and accessible resource for all. Since then, the Waterfront Alliance has grown into a coalition of  more than 1,100 organizations working together to bring about real change to our region’s waterways and 700 miles of shoreline.
Our Vision
New York Harbor and the surrounding waterways should be a shared resource for all. Our coastal communities must resolutely prepare for the reality of sea level rise and be prepared for the next big storm. Adapting to this new reality, we will create healthy, resilient, accessible, and equitable waterways that are alive with commerce and recreation, and exciting waterfront destinations that reflect the vitality and diversity of the communities that surround them.
What We Do
After more than a decade of leading the charge in how the New York metropolitan region views and uses its harbor, and with more than 1,000 Alliance Partners committed to bringing real change to our region’s 700+ miles of coastline, in 2019 the Waterfront Alliance stepped into a new and critical leadership role to define New York Harbor’s response to sea level rise and coastal storms. Our crucial, long-term focus on increasing waterfront accessibility for all, along with our efforts to advocate for a working waterfront that is a vital source of business activity and well-paying jobs and educating the next generation of waterfront stewards, continue as essential pillars of our work to create a well-adapted and resilient New York Harbor."

Cooling today is neither economically, environmentally, nor preparationally sustainable

Up to 90% of the cooling systems 20-year life cycle costs are driven by energy and maintenance costs, which are rising fast
Cooling already consumes 25-30% of electricity worldwide and is responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and cooling consumption is expected to increase 33-fold by 2100
The refrigeration industry is projected to face a shortfall of 180,000 qualified technicians by 2025

We believe that these huge problems can be solved using the proven playbook of IoT, artificial intelligence, and automation.
Our mission: Use software and automation to transform how the world's cooling systems are powered, operated, and maintained, in order to generate significant climate and financial impact.
The cooling industry is on a collision course with shortages of qualified technicians, tightening refrigerant regulations, rising energy costs, inadequate power grids, and warming climates worldwide. We cannot remain on this path — we need to change the strategy.
We provide value to our customers and make cooling systems more sustainable in the following ways: 

By predicting equipment issues and making cooling systems more efficient, we lower maintenance costs reduce the energy required to achieve the same amount of cooling.
By adding power flexibility and energy storage to cooling systems, we generate revenue for our customers and enable higher penetration of intermittent renewables (solar, wind, etc) onto the grid.
By identifying and curtailing refrigerant leaks early, we help reduce the amount of high-GWP refrigerants released into the atmosphere.

1132244,DroneSeed,[51-100],www.droneseed.com,Carbon Removal Tech,"Seattle, WA, USA","About DroneSeed/Silvaseed: 
 
Our mission is simple: Make reforestation scalable to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Trees are highly effective at carbon removal, but scaling reforestation has significant obstacles--and that gets our team fired up about how we can build solutions using technology.  We’ve built DroneSeed and acquired and combined it with 130-year-old Silvaseed to be a one-stop-shop for reforestation and remove obstacles at each of four steps: 
 
- Seed.  Natural regeneration after wildfire is in decline due to climate change resulting in larger fires of higher severity. These factors eliminate seed stored in the soil for regeneration. This creates challenges for seed supply. To respond we’ve expanded Silvaseed to become the largest private seed bank in the west and the first call for land managers affected by fire.  
 
- Grow space. There’s not enough nursery greenhouse capacity to grow seedlings (link). We’re currently growing millions of seedlings per year at Silvaseed and, while we’re doubling that output, we’re creating a replicable method to scale further.  
 
- Better tools for labor. We need better tools to accomplish more reforestation faster. DroneSeed is utilizing heavy lift drone swarms to deliver seed vessels after wildfire and boost seed establishment in combination with seedlings that are interplanted later. 
 
- Finance. For the last 20 years, carbon offsets haven’t provided capital for the high-up front costs of reforestation. Repayment periods were 25 years or more and reforestation projects were exceedingly rare. That changed two years ago when third party certifier Climate Action Reserve (CAR) announced the Climate Forward protocol to conservatively forecast the carbon tonne removals as reforested trees grow. DroneSeed is developing one of the first projects using this protocol. This and future projects following the protocol will be protected by legal easements on replanted and re-seeded land, monitored by state-accredited land trusts, and have insurance buffer pools in place in case fire occurs again. Under the CAR protocol, DroneSeed is generating the most transparent, highest-quality forestry-based carbon offsets on the market from reforestation projects. 
 
We need to overcome these four reforestation challenges to build back--even a fraction of--the forests we lose from wildfires every year. That's why we set out to build a model to make reforestation scaleable, which requires expanding the supply chain systems and financial flywheels behind them. That is the mission: make reforestation scalable to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

Collate & release data, and write software tools to make it super-easy for people to consume the data.
Run a collaborative “global research project” where everyone from 16-year-olds to PhD students to corporate research labs can help find better ML solutions.
Help to put good ideas into production so that we can start reducing emissions ASAP, and so we can test if the solution really does help in practice.

 
To date, we have built a community of over 1,000 interested volunteers and collaborated with various researchers from institutions such as University College London, University of Edinburgh, Stanford University, The Alan Turing Institute and the Open Data Institute. We also work closely with industry partners.
Currently, we are focused on our solar electricity Nowcasting project. As clouds move over solar panels, the power output moves up and down rapidly. To keep the energy grid in balance, operators need to have readily available power generation reserves which usually come from fossil fuel sources. With better forecasts (short-term forecasts are called nowcasts), we will be able to reduce the amount of fossil fuel reserve required. We will now build solar Nowcasting as a product. Our ultimate aim is to reduce annual CO2 emissions by approximately 100 million tonnes globally by 2030. We are engaged in this project with an industry partner with the intention to deploy it in a production environment."

But the UN estimates that we have only 11 years left to change our consumption patterns before we do irreversible damage to the environment, so we’re of the opinion that now is the time for big bets.
We’re starting in the world of recycling, which has a huge opportunity for impact. Americans send 1.4 million tons of waste to recycling facilities every week (that’s about 4 Empire State Buildings, or 1.5 Golden Gate Bridges). We’re also really bad at it: 25% of what we put in our recycling bins isn’t even recyclable. These recycling facilities make a living by sorting our jumbled-up waste and they need to do it cheaply and accurately. Otherwise they go out of business and our recycling goes straight to the landfill. Even so, recycling facilities today use processes that are highly manual, expensive, and error prone. We plan to revolutionize the way these facilities use technology, to make them more streamlined, accurate, and profitable - which means more recyclables avoid the landfill, and more of our natural resources are protected.
Our growing team draws from the brightest and most passionate professionals across robotics, manufacturing, software, AI, and market strategy. We’re united by our deep-rooted passion to make a big environmental impact, and we’re looking for other mission-driven, creative thinkers to help us right the ship on this truly global issue."

Most previous wave energy technologies have been developed for deep water applications, requiring floating units. Floating objects are inherently less efficient at absorbing the energy in waves. And, in almost all cases, these technologies have been reliant on moving parts in the water, which have often been their downfall. Having moving parts in the water results in prohibitively high maintenance costs, particularly when the technology is located in deep water. The WSE technology involves no moving parts in the water. The only moving parts – the turbine and the simple flap valves – are located well above the water line. In addition, the technology involves no oils, lubricants or contaminants.
More closely related to the WSE technology, though, is the class of technologies known as oscillating water columns (OWCs). All previous OWC technologies have been bidirectional, requiring air turbines that operate on reversing flow. This necessitates either an inefficient turbine, a more complex turbine with pitching blades, or a complicated system requiring the redirection of flow on each cycle. The WSE technology, however, is fundamentally different in that it utilises unidirectional flow allowing for a simpler, more robust, more efficient and cheaper air turbine."

1976,Noon Energy,[1-10],http://www.cyclotronroad.org/noonenergy,Energy,"California, USA","Noon Energy is pioneering a flow battery technology that enables economical long-duration energy storage. Our design will allow intermittent renewable electricity sources, such as solar and wind, to meet continual demand.FELLOWChristopher GravesChristopher GravesChris Graves has focused on sustainable energy and materials since 2004. After receiving his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 2010 on the topic of storing renewable electricity by converting CO2 and H2O into hydrocarbon fuels with high temperature electrolysis cells, he continued electrochemistry research at the Technical University of Denmark, most recently as a senior scientist. Graves has led projects on novel electrochemical energy storage technologies, from new materials to modeling and characterization of cells to design and techno-economic analysis of systems. He has collaborated with NASA and was a visiting scholar at Stanford University on related electrochemical materials and devices.In 2012 he invented a new type of rechargeable flow battery. After extensive lab-scale proof-of-concept research, he founded Noon Energy in 2018 to further develop and commercialize this breakthrough technology.TECHNOLOGYCritical NeedSolar and wind power are growing rapidly and dominating new electricity generation globally. New low-cost energy storage technologies are urgently needed to balance these intermittent renewables. Available storage systems are inadequate: conventional batteries and electrolytic hydrogen are too expensive and pumped hydro and compressed air are geographically constrained. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, flow batteries and reversible electrolyzers decouple energy capacity and power capacity, which means the cost of storage decreases with increasing storage duration. However, these flow systems suffer from expensive storage media (vanadium) or low roundtrip energy efficiency (power-to-gas and back), and complex balance-of-system for flow management. All of these factors have kept long-duration storage for grid-scale renewable energy out of reach.Technology VisionNoon Energy's battery can match the energy efficiency of lithium-ion technology while using ultra-low-cost storage, enabling system-level costs of less than $50 per kWh capacity for hours or days of storage time.Whereas existing batteries store energy in relatively expensive metals like vanadium, cobalt, and lithium, our battery stores energy in ultra-low-cost elements like hydrogen, carbon and oxygenstorage media that cost well below $1 per kWh capacity. The clear target is long-duration storage coupled to intermittent solar and wind power to provide dispatchable electricity, a market which is growing quickly due to increasing deployment and falling costs of these clean energy sources.Potential for Impact Long-duration, economical energy storage will make a major contribution to revolutionizing the energy sector and integrating rapidly growing solar and wind renewable electricity supplies, beginning with stationary storage. In addition, the high energy density of the Noon Energy battery opens the door to transportation applications such as electric vehicles and aircraft. Low-cost storage would reduce energy imports, pollution, and emissions.Noon is Looking for...Technical collaboratorsFundersJoint development partnersTeam members - engineers, interns"

The Yield is an Australian agricultural technology company. We’re on a mission to transform food and farming practices by building secure, scalable digital technology.

We work closely with produce growers to design our products because we’re committed to solving real challenges – at farm level and throughout the food chain.
No one knows the land better than growers. We want to help them make faster, more informed decisions that impact yield and reduce their risks. We do this by providing an integrated set of AgTech solutions that sense, analyse and predict on-farm growing conditions, and then deliver information in a usable format.

The Yield technology combines hardware, data analytics and user-friendly apps. Our AgTech solutions can be applied across the food chain to help increase yield, reduce waste, mitigate the risk and cost associated with bad weather, and aid environmental sustainability.

The world needs to produce 60 per cent more food by 2050 to feed the planet. This is happening during a time of unprecedented resource constraints and climate change. Our vision is to help meet this challenge without compromising the future.

It’s this challenge that brings us together. The Yield has a highly-focused team combining leading engineers, data scientists, agriculturists and technologists. We have a deep commitment to open innovation, collaboration and diversity."

As corporate water use and wastewater treatment specialists, our journey began when helping a client solve an urgent compliance problem.

Almost immediately we realized problems were not outside in the treatment plant; they were inside the building.
If we could eliminate our client's unnecessary water use and contamination at the source, their compliance issues would disappear. Not only would this be better for the environment, our client would avoid spending millions on building and running new treatment plants. A big idea was born.
Tests at several locations proved the idea could work. Our client reduced their water use by more than 20%. Savings exceeded the cost of keeping waste in check.
APANA has been on a mission to eliminate water waste in the built environment ever since.

Black Bear brings them into the circular economy!

We are the world's first producer of Cradle to Cradle Certified™ carbon black.  We choose to change the industry with breakthrough technology and with passionate people. Carbon black is usually produced by burning fossil fuels and therefore emitting large amounts of CO2. We produce carbon black by extracting it from waste tires and converting the remains of the tires into oil and gas. These green energy sources can be converted to heat, electricity or steam and they provide an additional income stream to our business model.

Carbon black is a crucial component in rubber, plastics, inks, and paints and is used to modify their properties into usable products. Almost everything that you see around you that is black in color has carbon black in it.  We change the game by making a better and sustainable product - a circular product for a better world. 

We partner with tire collectors around the world so that we can tackle the waste tire problem as fast as possible. Because we truly believe that if we don't act now we will be left with an even bigger environmental problem.

Visit our website for more information on our process, our team, and our ambitions.

Farming is risky. For farmers who are building the quality of their soil every year, insecure land tenure critically inhibits multi-year business planning. Many talented farmers with profitable operations do not qualify for a conventional loan and/or do not have enough capital saved to make a large down payment. The primary alternative is leased land, which is often short-term, insecure and requires permission from landowners to erect basic farm infrastructure. Dirt Capital fills these gaps by facilitating farmland transitions, crafting long-term leases that allow businesses to expand securely, and providing defined pathways to ownership.

FARMER PARTNERS
We work with sustainable farmers who have successful, existing operations, established markets and the opportunity to grow and expand their business through long-term, secure land access.

Most of our land investment partnerships result from a farmer contacting Dirt Capital with one of the following scenarios:

Relocate an existing farm to a larger property, or to a farm with more secure land tenure

Expand a successful operation by acquiring nearby land

Transfer a farm to non-family or family successors

Conserve when land trusts look to partner with a like-minded organization, or keep already conserved land in active agricultural production

6321,Membrion,[1-10],membrion.com/,Materials & Manufacturing,"Seattle, WA, USA","Filtering Ions to Save the Planet
Membrion™  is at the forefront of some of the world’s most challenging problems: clean water, global electrification and human health. The emerging technologies designed to revolutionize these fields all depend on filtering charged molecules, called ions. The need for low cost/high performance ion filters has never been stronger or more urgent.



One only has to look at California to see the potential impact of ion filters on drinking and agricultural water supplies. With annual snowpack deletion and persistent drought fueled by climate change, California (and many other parts of the world) faces fresh water crisis. One of the most viable solutions to this challenge is to purify brackish water through electrodialysis. While the state has 38 times more brackish water than fresh water supplies, and while electrodialysis is less costly than older technologies like reverse osmosis, existing expensive and low performance ion filters have prevented electrodialysis from being widely adopted. Membrion’s low cost/high performance membranes will enable dramatically lower cost solutions to produce potable water for agriculture and urban usage, all while using less energy and creating less waste than existing solutions today.



Ion filters are also at the heart of the burgeoning urban mobility market which is moving towards low cost, electric-powered solutions that are available on-demand. Each of these new solutions, from the scooter to the bike to the car, rely on Li-ion or other batteries today, or fuel cells tomorrow. In both cases, the word will need efficient and effective ion filters to expand beyond the capacity of today’s solutions.



This need is not isolated to transportation. California is the 5th largest economy in the world and is moving to 100% renewable energy by 2045, and some of the world’s largest and most admired brands, including Google, Ikea, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Nike, GM and Lego among many others, have also committed to 100% renewable energy. Energy storage is key to that success and new low cost/high performance ion filters are the limiting factor for today’s generation of flow batteries, the most promising grid scale-storage solution.

It’s hard to believe that such small molecules have such a big impact on the world’s future, but they do. Our efforts to bring a unique ion filter to market can materially accelerate a variety of new technologies to improve the lives of humans today and protect the future health of our planet."

We’ve since built a small team within Stripe to focus on creating a market for carbon removal by being an early customer for promising negative emissions technologies.
Today, after a rigorous search and review by a panel of independent scientific experts[1], we’re excited to announce our first purchases. Our request for projects garnered a wide range of negative emissions technologies which came in two broad categories.


Carbon storage in the biosphere: These projects include planting trees or modifying agricultural practices to store more carbon in soil. These projects are relatively less expensive and benefit from immediate scale (we can plant trees today), but have shorter long-term permanence since trees can be easily burned down and carbon storage in soil can be short lived. These solutions alone are unlikely to sustain the necessary 6-15 gigatons of annual CO2 removal.


Carbon storage outside of the biosphere: Projects in this more nascent category store carbon in places besides plants and soil. Examples include directly capturing CO2 from the atmosphere and injecting it into stable rock formations underground or sequestering CO2 in concrete via mineralization. These solutions are scarce and dramatically underfunded. If they can proliferate and scale, they’ll complement in-biosphere solutions by bringing new benefits: thousand-year or longer permanence and vast carbon storage using minimal arable land.


The world will need a portfolio of negative emissions approaches across these two categories to meet the 2 degree warming target sensibly adopted by many governments. We believe Stripe can make the most impact by focusing our purchases on the latter category to help these solutions improve"

Second Nature is committed to accelerating climate action in, and through, higher education.

We do this by mobilizing a diverse array of higher education institutions to act on bold climate commitments, to scale campus climate initiatives, and to create innovative climate solutions. We align, amplify, and bridge the sector’s efforts with other global leaders to advance urgent climate priorities.

Vision
We envision humanity thriving through healthy, just, and sustainable living within a dynamically changing earth system. We see higher education playing a prominent leadership role in shaping research, learning, and communities that inspire and operationalize this positive future. Second Nature serves as a critical driver for leaders in higher education that commit to this responsibility.

Strategy
From its founding, Second Nature has worked to expand higher education’s ability to solve pressing sustainability challenges. Since 2006, that focus has been aimed at addressing the largest environmental challenge that civilization has faced: global climate change. This was the launch year of the Presidents’ Climate Leadership Commitments, now the longest standing voluntary carbon reduction program in the world, and through it the Climate Leadership Network of over 600 universities and colleges formed.

Our 2019-2022 Strategic Plan focuses on the imperative for exponential growth in climate progress to work towards 50% decarbonization in the US economy by 2030 based on advice from the best available science. This three year plan focuses on supporting network performance and cross-sector activity with the core of our strategy centered around the expansion of valued climate services.

We will continue activating more schools as climate leaders and driving climate action with other sectors, but need “better and more of it” within this 11-year window of opportunity to act. Leveraging higher education’s innovative research and partnership strengths will be key to proactively overcome the climate emergency.

What Defines Us
We will strive to have our commitments to diversity, transparency, humility, innovation, and community be qualities that are said about us, not characteristics that we simply declare. These values serve as our mirror as well as our lens for focused decision-making, internal organizational dynamics, and engagement with external stakeholders.

Diversity
At Second Nature, we recognize the fundamental value of diversity, and the essential role it plays in building a sustainable and positive global future. We are committed to a diverse workplace in which all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, because we believe that an inclusive, supportive environment enables us to thrive, and better meet the needs of our network and the communities we serve.

To us, the term diversity recognizes and encourages social and cultural differences, as well as individual ones. Current and historical inequities create uneven access to opportunities, and we are committed to breaking down those barriers in our work. We understand diversity to be not only the absence of discriminatory behavior or opinions, but also the active support of passionate, smart, and motivated employees and partners from a variety of backgrounds and experiences.

Embracing true diversity involves hiring, engaging, and supporting people who represent many perspectives, think differently, and challenge our assumptions. Diversity is the backbone of an innovative and vibrant organization, and though pursuing it is not always easy — it is vital. We are continually learning, and striving towards growth and action that will allow us to better affirm diversity and equity in our work, and serve as a model of change for others in the field."

The flying craft operates at an average altitude of 100 meters. This higher altitude (of traditional small wind turbines) allows us to access stronger, more reliable winds in more locations. In addition, the aerodynamic forces exerted on the flying craft are harnessed to pull the tether harder, generating more power.

Our story
ChargeLab was founded in 2015 by a team of veteran software engineers and entrepreneurs. Our goal from day 1 was to simplify the fragmented and confusing world of open-standard electric vehicle infrastructure.Driving an electric car should feel like stepping into the future: clean energy, easy refuelling, and better technology all around. While manufacturers like Tesla, Nissan, BMW, and Chevrolet had started to fulfill this promise by 2015, EV charging providers had not. In 2015, charging your EV felt like a step backwards.We went from a vast network of petrol refuelling spots where all you had to do was tap your credit card, to a fragmented group of EV charging networks that created more friction than filling up a petrol vehicle. EV drivers must download a dozen different apps just to charge around town. In the early days, software bugs and poorly deployed hardware made public charging so unreliable that most EV drivers settled on just charging at home.But this is not the way the world needs to be. Refuelling an EV should be easier than refuelling a gasoline vehicle. There are far more places to connect to the electric grid than there are 12,000 gallon-tanks filled with petrol laying around. Every apartment, condo, office building, shopping center, and home has a connection to the grid—and thus can be a refuelling point for EVs.ChargeLab's mission is to make it easier for sites and installers to deploy EV chargers, easier for EV drivers to use them, and give utilities more powerful tools for managing EV charging on a grid-wide scale.Our long-term vision stretches decades into the future to a world where all transportation is zero-emission and all the energy we use is renewable. We're far from realizing this vision today—but we welcome you to join us on our journey there!

Our experts and writers deliver timely research and analysis that is accessible to the public, applying insights gleaned from a variety of disciplines to arrive at new ideas for solving pressing problems.
New Economy Program
An underlying assumption of the national conversation about economic problems and political alienation is that if only America could create more jobs, and people could produce, or acquire, more goods, our quality of life would improve and many of our woes would disappear.
That assumption is wrong. The quest to keep making more things in the same old ways has left us with ecological and social challenges that undermine the vast potential of our society. And with respect to distribution, such a wealthy nation clearly has enough food, homes, and “stuff” for everyone, if we chose to distribute what we have more evenly.
Our quality of life will only improve when we accept that economic growth doesn’t automatically deliver happiness, and begin to make decisions, both in and beyond the economic realm, to support meaningful lives. We need to build communities that facilitate social connections, support family caregivers, restore the beauty in our neighborhoods, and enable people to pursue what brings them satisfaction. Frontier Group’s New Economy Program is dedicated to developing policy that acknowledges our material abundance and helps make real the possibilities of our 21st-century world."

In this industrial age, massive quantities of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, have been released into our atmosphere through the combustion of fossil fuels to meet humankind's industrial, transportation and energy needs. These greenhouse gases trap infrared heat increasing the temperature of the planet (global warming) at an accelerating rate. Climate change causes species extinction. As many as half the species on the planet face extinction this century if climate change is not abated. Climate change is causing sea-level rise, which is already threatening disappearance of low-lying countries, glaciers and icebergs, along with causing interior flooding, drought, famine, disease, hurricanes, increased incidence and strength of tornados, communication, power and transportation disruptions, and causing wide-spread increasing economic cost to both developed and under developed countries throughout the world.

At George Washington University we’ve discovered the inexpensive transformation of the greenhouse carbon dioxide into a widely useful and highly valued product. In our C2CNT process, CO2 is directly transformed to hollow nanofibers, “carbon nanotubes,” products with remarkable properties of conductivity, nanoelectronics, higher capacity batteries, flexibility, with greater strength than steel and widespread use as carbon composites. The conversion of CO2 to pure carbon nanotubes provides the most compact form to capture carbon dioxide and mitigate climate change. The market for carbon composites provides lighter weight alternatives to metals, and is used today in the Boeing Dreamliner, high end sport cars, and athletic equipment. The market is experiencing an explosive growth comparable to the historical start of the plastic industry. Previously carbon nanofibers were made by expensive processes such as chemical vapor deposition or polymer pulling and could not be made from CO2. Our C2CNT team is rapidly scaling-up our new chemistry which directly converts CO2 at high rate to carbon nanotubes using low cost materials. The C2CNT team is committed to reversing the rapid anthropogenic buildup of greenhouse gases, and perceive CO2 not as a pollutant, but rather CO2 as a useful resource. We are working to incentivize CO2 removal from the power, industry and transportation sectors by rapidly and efficiently transforming CO2 into a valuable product."

Sunlight hits the Earth and bounces off to space at the speed of light.

Our microsatellite-based sensor captures the light that is reflecting off the ground, and by using advanced optics, instantly recognizes the unique spectral fingerprint of methane.

6525,PowerGen Renewable Energy,[101-250],www.powergen-renewable-energy.com/,Energy,"Kenya, Nairobi","PowerGen was founded in Nairobi, Kenya in 2011 on the basis of two simple ideas:

(1) All over the world, renewable technologies continue their ascent as the energy sources of the future.

(2) Africa is poised for enormous continued growth and innovation in the decades ahead.

PowerGen’s objective was to build an exciting and impactful business at the nexus of these two themes.

Our first realization was that in Africa there are no shortage of good ideas, but execution is key and can prevent transformative ideas from realizing their potential. So we set out to build a first-class executional business focused on engineering, design, procurement, and installation of kW-scale off-grid solar and wind power systems in East Africa.

“Over the course of 5 years, PowerGen installed hundreds of renewable energy systems across seven countries in East Africa, and built a team of more than 50 full-time professionals”
Through our engineering and installation business we learned a lot about what it takes to succeed in Africa, and a more granular understanding of what the region’s energy sector needs.  We realized that our clean, off-grid power systems were great, but many people couldn’t benefit from them since the up front cost is significant.  We then began looking at ways we could finance these assets in order to provide energy as a service, which led us into the world of micro-grids.

“We built our first micro-grid in 2013 in Zambia, and since then have installed dozens more across Kenya and Tanzania.”
Over the course of 5 years, PowerGen installed hundreds of renewable energy systems across seven countries in East Africa, and built a team of more than 50 full-time professionals focused on delivering exceptional off-grid power systems to the region.

We built our first micro-grid in 2013 in Zambia, and since then have installed dozens more across Kenya and Tanzania.  Thousands of people benefit from the clean energy we sell to them on a pay-as-they-go basis throughout rural areas of East Africa.

But our micro-grid business isn’t just about increasing energy access – it’s also about leading the charge in implementing the future energy system of Africa.  Africa, with its weak incumbent infrastructure, shouldn’t be aiming to build an energy system emulating that of the US or Europe today.  Instead we must be focused on building the energy system of the future, converging on where the US and Europe will be decades from now.

What does this future energy system look like?  It will involve on-grid storage, distributed generation, and smart metering.  It will incorporate more intelligent tariffs and billing systems.  It will be modular, acting more like a network composed of many semi-autonomous nodes rather than a monodirectional pipeline for commoditized electrons.  Customers will be treated as customers for energy and other services, not just as ‘ratepayers’ that happen to be on the other end of a wire.

At PowerGen, we are focused on building the power utility company of the future which will allow Africa to make the leap to surpass the aging power models and infrastructure of the more developed world. As the leading micro-utility company in East Africa with dozens of projects in operation, we welcome friends and partners as we work together to make this vision a reality."

Thermal energy storage is one of the oldest technologies known to mankind as ‘hot rocks’ were used for the basic survival techniques of food and shelter. All substances hold an amount of heat energy, known as their thermal capacity. When a solid is heated it increases in temperature until it reaches its phase change point. When further energy is applied it does not increase the temperature, but causes the substance to change from a solid to a liquid or gas. The energy generated from this phase change is able to be stored.

CCT Energy Storage’s thermal battery incorporates a unique phase change material that can store energy at more than 12 times the energy density of a lead acid battery. The stored energy can then be extracted from the thermal battery via a heat engine, to provide an electricity supply when needed.

The thermal battery is not only suitable for renewable energy such as wind and solar; it is also adaptable to non-renewable energy sources from fossil fuels."

But that’s not the whole story, and it never will be. At Grist, we find reasons for hope and optimism every day — while also irritating and shaming those who stand in the way of progress. Our independent, nonprofit newsroom pursues in-depth stories on under-covered topics like clean energy, sustainable food, livable cities, environmental justice, and a better economy. We elevate solutions, expose inequity, and give our readers the context, knowledge, and tools to make a difference.
Our new venture, Fix, is taking the next step toward achieving a more just and sustainable future. Each year we feature the most promising green innovators and influencers in our annual Grist 50. Then we bring this unexpected network together to spur conversations and collaborations. Technologists, activists, artists, politicians, storytellers — their integrated skills and connected goals are what we need right now.
Our mantra these days: Don’t freak out. Figure it out.
Where, you might ask, do we find this boundless energy and enthusiasm? Turns out, with the right team and plenty of reader support, they are renewable resources! Grist was founded in 1999 as one of the nation’s first online-only publications, covering serious topics without taking ourselves too seriously. TIME magazine calls Grist “the Colbert Report of climate change … except with real reporting and analytical journalism.”

Have you met our long-running advice columnist Ask Umbra? She’s had a makeover to highlight civic engagement and community action (important stuff in the age of Trump). We’re a founding member of the Climate Desk, sharing stories from some of America’s leading publications.

We created Offset Earth so people like you can actually take on the climate crisis




Our collective home is in the process of being turned totally upside down which is leading to strife for almost all life on Earth.
We know it’s preventable. And we know it’s not going to save itself.
So, it is up to us to solve it. But what levers can we pull? Reducing our carbon footprint is entirely necessary, but the transition of change is far slower than the time we have remaining.
The tools that we associate with fighting climate change are inadequate. What if that changed and the billions of us who care became empowered?
There are enough climate solutions that are out there right now, that if we supported them, it’d undo 30 years of carbon damage by avoiding 1,500 billion tonnes of CO2.
This is our opportunity.
Tree planting

It’s now common knowledge that one of the best tools to tackle the climate crisis and keep our temperatures from rising above 1.5C is to plant trees. They are also crucial to preventing ecological collapse.
Our tree planting partner The Eden Reforestation Projects plant millions of trees around the world each month. We are currently supporting their incredible work in Madagascar.
Carbon offsetting

At Offset Earth we invest your money into projects that remove more greenhouse gasses than your own carbon footprint puts in.
Each month we pick the best CO2 reduction projects with Gold Standard certification, so you can trust your money is going to the highest rated projects and making the most impact possible.

Agricarbon is an industry leader in helping a wide range of high-end/top draw clients to participate in removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in soil. Over 150 years of industrialised farming, the world has stripped billions of tonnes of organic carbon from our soils, reducing its critical fertility, biodiversity and water-holding capacity.
The opportunity to restore organic carbon through regenerative farming practices is transformative in:

Restoring a healthy soil ecosystem rich in organic matter, for a resilient future food and farming system
Reducing the impact of agriculture on climate change
Removing anthropogenic CO2 (returned to soils as organic Carbon) - on a massive scale

Demand for carbon removal is forecast to grow exponentially in the next few decades and nature-based solutions such as soil carbon restoration are relatively low-cost initiatives deployable at great scale. These solutions present considerable environmental, economic and social co-benefits on a global basis and well into the future It has been estimated that agricultural soils have the capacity to capture up to 1 trillion tonnes of CO2 through regenerative farming practices. This is clearly big business.
 
Agricarbon plays a vital role in the market – by measuring the CO2 being sequestered into soils – to unlock carbon incentives and investments to help catalyse a wholesale transition to regenerative farming and land-use.
 
Agricarbon is an ambitious scale-up in the fast-emerging climate-tech space with a proven track-record. We have developed an innovative technology-based service that measures soil carbon with the highest level of accuracy and at ultra-low cost which provides a vital missing link: reliable evidence of soil carbon sequestration (capturing/securing carbon in soil) to secure payments for and investment in CO2 removal, unlocking soil as a vast carbon sink and new income for farmers and landowners."

Mad Capital is a Boulder Colorado based company established to accelerate the regenerative and organic revolution in agriculture! We are working to transition 10M acres of farmland to regenerative and organic production in the next 10 years by providing farmers with strategic financial products and resources.

Why it matters - Through our reliance on industrial and extractive agricultural practices, we’ve systematically degraded ecosystems and created many of the largest challenges humanity has ever faced, from declining soil fertility, and dwindling rural wealth, to biodiversity loss, and climate change—and we’re running out of time to fix it.
Why regenerative agriculture - Regenerative organic agriculture is a system of farming principles and practices that focuses on maximizing the health of soil, people, and ecosystems. It takes a living systems approach, working with nature, rather than against it, and it actually isn’t new. Forward-thinking farmers have been using many of these practices for decades, but they need support if we’re really serious about turning this thing around.
Why Mad Capital - The idea of Mad Capital started in 2018 with the team developing, launching, and deploying a first-of-its-kind regenerative and organic agriculture investment fund. Today we’re a nimble, well-capitalized team composed of exceptional individuals and dreamers supported by the broader Mad Agriculture family, our network of partners, advisors, mentors, investors, friends, and a growing community of like-minded folks working to build better agricultural systems around the world.

JOIN US!
We don’t have time to mess around! To curb the current use—and reverse the legacy—of industrial and extractive agricultural practices, we need to direct billions of dollars into the regenerative organic space as soon as possible. We need ambitious, creative, and empathetic people like you to get this done. With this need in mind, we have an amazing opportunity for an experienced, finance-oriented Director of Marketing to join the revolution in agriculture!"

Our Mission:

























Yard Stick provides easy, accurate, and affordable quantification of soil carbon stocks. Our mission is to enable gigaton-scale agricultural carbon sequestration via scalable, trustworthy measurement solutions. We are the measurement backbone of soil carbon.

 

Scientists and farmers alike have known for decades that climate-friendly agricultural practices have the potential to remove atmospheric GHGs at gigaton/year scale. But significant measurement challenges have held soil carbon back - until now. By reducing the cost of statistically-sound and agronomically-legitimate soil carbon measurement by 90%+, Yard Stick will dramatically expand the opportunities for evidence-based regenerative agriculture and ranching practices to simultaneously improve ecosystem health, increase farmer/rancher livelihoods, and combat climate change.
 

Our Technology:Powered by technologies from the world’s top soil scientists and supported by leading grant funders and venture investors, Yard Stick brings soil carbon measurement into the 21st century. Our solution spans an integrated suite of software and hardware offerings which solve key soil carbon measurement challenges.




Our flagship hardware technology is a rapid, in situ soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density (BD) measurement probe for field evaluation of soil carbon stocks. This handheld device, based on over a decade of soil spectroscopy research, is currently being validated in Midwest farming contexts and, at maturity, will replace conventional soil sampling and labs.
Yard Stick’s broader software offering, available now, combines technologies that standardize and economize sample plan creation, sample tracking, and soil C stock data management in an integrated web-based platform. These features help establish a single SOC data authority - a key requirement as regen ag and soil C efforts mature.
Our work is funded by significant recent USDA Climate Smart Commodities awards, additional grants from ARPA-E, NSF, and CDFA, as well as by leading climate investors such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures (Bill Gate's climate fund) and Lowercarbon Capital (Chris and Crystal Sacca's climate fund). Additionally, our co-founding scientific advisory team features some of the most highly-regarded soil scientists in the world, including Dr. Cristine Morgan of the Soil Health Institute.

For the majority of the modern building era, this was just chalked up as a common problem – one that contractors and homeowners just accepted.


It all started in Dr. Mark Modera’s California garage in 1993, where he invented a breakthrough aerosol-based sealing technology. For the first time ever, it was possible to seal leaks and holes in air ducts from the inside out. Up until that time, the only way to seal ductwork was messy, labor intensive, and not an option for most homeowners.
Modera’s invention was very well received amongst the industry and was even awarded the prestigious Energy Top 100 award by the US Department of Energy.
After trying to bring the technology to market through a major heating and air manufacturer, Dr. Mark Modera teamed up with Amit Gupta – a heating & air industry leader, to bring Aeroseal technology to homeowners all over the country.
Their mission has remained the same since day one: to deliver comfort, healthy air, and substantial energy savings to homeowners everywhere.  Our biggest goal: shrink carbons emissions from building and homes by 1 gigaton!

We all understand the threat that climate change presents. Our warming atmosphere puts us on a collision course with extreme weather, food shortages, mass extinction, and social unrest. We’ve already emitted more carbon than is safe, and we’re not reducing fast enough. The threat is real, it will affect everyone, and we’re almost out of time.
To avoid climate catastrophe, we need to radically reduce our carbon emissions and remove the excess from our atmosphere. The problem is, our current economic system makes it easier and more profitable to emit carbon than to avoid doing so. Maintaining this status quo doesn’t just guarantee climate change, it also prevents businesses doing what they’re best at to be part of the solution. It shouldn’t be this way.
Instead, we need a platform that makes it easy to fund carbon removal. A platform that allows businesses to help repair our planet by removing any carbon emissions they can’t yet avoid creating. An open platform that everyone can invest in with confidence, no matter how big or small their contribution. A platform that allows individuals, businesses, and nature to thrive, while creating a legacy we can be proud of.
By creating a massive marketplace for carbon removal, starting with regenerative agriculture projects that store carbon in the soil, we can repair our climate and fund a better future.

While our roots are in the wellness and personal care category, we’re growing to serve a broader set of markets, including food, household cleaning, and more. 
The opportunity in front of us is vast (a $1.5T market), our mission is urgent, and we’re well-funded by top-tier VC firms (Defy, Greylock, and Tiger Global) who are making the investments required to achieve it. We’re looking for talented people passionate about sustainability to join us in building the future of consumer product development. If that’s you, let’s talk!"

1132682,AeroShield Materials Inc.,[11-50],https://www.aeroshield.tech/,Materials & Manufacturing,,"AeroShield is making the next generation of energy-efficient windows possible by manufacturing the first ultra-clear, super-insulating aerogel sheets.
Windows are critical elements of comfort and productivity, but in the United States they cost $40 billion in heating and cooling energy. Every year 50+ million new window units add to this growing problem, but what if we were no longer forced to choose between insulating our walls for indoor comfort and accessing natural daylight and beautiful outdoor views? Scientists from MIT have developed breakthrough advances in nanoporous glass, the same material used to insulate spacecraft, to enable a new performance class of windows that offer affordability and efficiency.
New super-insulating material developed by AeroShield is designed to drop inside existing double-pane window manufacturing to create a window 50% more insulating – reducing energy use and improving comfort. Sealing AeroShield inside new windows enables energy payback faster than comparable products. Our thin, lightweight solution can be delivered and integrated into existing window manufacturing, achieving high performance at a low cost to enable $10 billion in energy savings and >500 million tons of CO2 reduction!"

First, the good news: Humans have installed a little over 1 TW of cumulative solar capacity over the last 20 years - solar is now the cheapest source of energy generation around the globe.
Now, the challenge: Humans have to build 1+ TW of solar capacity every year for the next 30+ years. We need to build new technology and overhaul how solar power is designed, developed, and built to make this happen.
And, we need help. We're expanding our team of curious, collaborative, and hands-on engineers and operators. Come own large parts of product, company, or business development and help make our big plans a reality!"

We have been an all-remote company since our founding, and we love the fact that remote work gives us flexibility to balance our roles as employees, parents, family members, or however else we round out our time. Remote work allows us to find great people wherever they happen to be, and it allows you to structure your day with minimal interruption so that you can get stuff done in the style that makes most sense for you.
Of course, spending time face-to-face is important, so every three months we pick a city and meet up for several days of highly productive and highly fun planning and doing. Past trips include Chicago, Austin, Los Angeles, Palm Springs, New Orleans, and more. Although we switched to remote versions of these meet-ups during the pandemic, we have been excited to have the opportunity to start meeting face to face again. Please note that we do require all employees to be vaccinated against Covid. 
We have a casual, collaborative work environment where everyone’s ideas matter. Since creative, enthusiastic employees are the basis for our success, we take great care and pride in how we attract, hire, and support our employees."
