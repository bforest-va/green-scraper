United like never before, we rise together—arm in arm—to equip all Indigenous Peoples with the tools needed to become architects of their future. Through a holistic approach to infrastructure, funding, advocacy, consulting, and philanthropy we are fostering a world of justice and equity for all people and the planet.
-- DEFEND OUR PEOPLE, COMMUNITIES, AND NATIONS
Negative resource extraction pollutes our water, destroys our land, contributes to climate change, and violates the rights of our people. Organizing our communities, making our voices heard, and utilizing a wide variety of tactics is imperative in shifting the political and financial systems that impact all aspects of life.
-- DEVELOP REGENERATIVE AND SUSTAINABLE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES
We need to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. We are doing this through regenerative community development, renewable energy investments and social enterprise development.
-- DECOLONIZE OUR MINDS, COMMUNITIES, AND SOVEREIGN NATIONS
The decolonization of our communities and people is directly related to our ability to prosper. Through the revitalization of our Indigenous ceremonies, culture, languages and life ways we will continue to strengthen our identity and break free from the oppressive systems that disconnect us from achieving the healing, growth and connection to spirit that is integral for us as Indigenous people."

We add content videos and blogs and searchable lists of highly successful climate projects abroad. WE can help replicate what works, by group training of local champions, to follow a proven system in local actions. Removing the barriers to entry of climate action is the goal, while improving success rate by 80%, while leveraging the group-think collaboration with like minded people doing the same thing you are doing. 
Phase 4.

Many want to know what they can do and if shown a way that is simple and easy to understand, will do more to reduce GHG emissions.

The results, we believe, will be powerful, if we can put all these pieces together. The easiest way to compare is to say that Earth Minute is like the power of compounding investment returns, where small, consistent momentum, builds over time. Time is our friend and not to fear!
We believe micro actions, is the secret to changing mindsets and hence habits. Taking only 1 minute each, and done daily, leads to positive habits people can feel good about and WANT to do more!

People feel like climate is an urgent problem but feel powerless to make a difference. We are empowering anyone to become a climate investor with as little as $5 so that everyone can benefit from the earnings of the energy transition. 
Climatize is an climate financial technology (FinTech) mobile application that sits uniquely at the crossroads of ClimateTech and the digitization of financial services by using crowdfunding to finance renewable energy projects. Climatize’s goal is to create the inclusive digital platform which can harness the collective financial power of the environmental movement by lowering the financial barrier for investment to just a few dollars, by giving investors full control of which projects their investments build and by providing a competitive return on investment. Climatize enables easy & automatic investments into loans for project developers constructing renewable energy projects. Investors receive a standardized, fixed rate, debt share in the project. Loan principal & interest are distributed back to the investors over the lifetime of the loan.
 
Why Climatize is the right solution
From the beginning Climatize is designed by the people, for the people. By creating an investment marketplace focused on the growing volume of the environmental movement we are leveraging the nature of the environmental movement and deploying an unaddressed tool to fight the climate crisis – the opportunity to incentivize collective action. The options you currently have to reduce your personal carbon footprint all require a varying degree of sacrifice such as eliminating meat from your diet or making a large investment to buy an electric vehicle or energy efficient appliances. For many people these options are either too hard or too expensive.
What Climatize is doing creates a new option; one which rewards you for the more environmental action you take. By bringing the minimum investment down to just a few cents, we are bringing impact investing within reach of everyone while creating a savings account that will save the world.
Climatize is opening an untapped source of finance for the renewable energy industry by focusing on including every financial level of impact investor."

Our founders, Alex and Andrew, have been around the ocean their entire lives. They both grew up on the Florida coast, swimming, diving, fishing, and surfing. After becoming friends in college, they saved up their money for the surf trip of a lifetime to Bali. When they arrived, they found a beach that was completely covered in plastic, with trash-filled waves delivering more garbage with each break.
They asked a local why such a popular, and otherwise beautiful, shoreline wasn't kept clean, and were told that the beaches had been cleaned just hours earlier. The trash they were wading through had only just washed ashore.
Their eyes were immediately opened to the magnitude of the ocean plastic crisis, and they vowed on the spot to try to do something about it.
Alex and Andrew decided to hire boat captains and other local workers to clean the ocean and coastlines full time. In order to make the biggest impact on this global problem, they launched their efforts in places like Bali where a lot of plastic and other garbage regularly accumulates.
Inspired by successful lifestyle brands that were able to build passionate followings, they decided to implement a business model that would allow them to grow quickly so they could pay workers, fund cleanups, and spread the word about the ocean plastic crisis.
So they created the 4ocean bracelet and pledged to pull a pound of trash from the ocean for each one purchased, using the profits to scale cleanup operations, make donations to ocean-related nonprofits, and build an organizational infrastructure to support future growth.
Even though 4ocean has collected millions of pounds of trash from the ocean and built an international infrastructure to fight the ocean plastic crisis, we're just getting started. The ocean plastic crisis is massive and growing.
It will take major systemic changes and the hard work of many great organizations each trying to tackle the crisis in different ways, as well as people like you who are committed to driving change.

Our proprietary Renewal System takes damaged apparel and textiles and turns them into Renewed Products, upcycling materials or feedstock for recycling. The Renewal Workshop operates a zero waste circular system that recovers the full value out of what has already been created as a way of serving customers, partners, and planet.The Renewal System is the process we developed to bridge gaps, connect systems, and mobilize leadership to make existing linear manufacturing practices circular. At its heart, it is a collaborative process that relies on progressive brand partners committed to sustainability.Brands and retailers lack systems to recover value from unsellable inventory. For garments that have been produced but cannot be sold, the creative, physical, natural and financial resources invested in them are lost. This leads to massive waste problems with negative environmental impacts, significant financial losses for brands and missed opportunities for consumers.The Renewal System takes discarded apparel and textiles and turns them into Renewed Apparel, upcycled materials or recycling feedstock. Data is collected on everything that flows through the system and is given back to our brand partners to help them improve the production and design of future products. It is a zero waste system that recovers the full value out of what has already been created as a way of serving customers, partners and planet.We are providing the apparel industry a completely circular and sustainable solution and we're providing customers a way to become zero waste consumers.We're doing this because we don't believe in throwing things away that aren't really trash."

TIPA was founded to create viable compostable, flexible packaging solutions









Packaging should behave just like an orange peel, so nature won’t even notice we’re here
The segments of an orange are packed by nature in a protective multilayer peel.When discarded, the orange peel decomposes and leaves no toxic residue; the compost left behind can be used as fertilizer for plant growth. 100% of the orange peel returns to nature.
TIPA was founded in 2010 by Daphna Nissenbaum and Tal Neuman to address the plastic waste challenge.
TIPA’s vision is for flexible packaging to have the same end-of-life as organic matter, while still offering consumers and brands the durability, transparency and shelf life they have come to expect from conventional plastics.
Yet compostable packaging can only succeed if it meets the same performance specifications as conventional plastic packaging. Compostable packaging should also be able to seamlessly fit into today’s methodology of logistics and manufacturing practices.


 







The Flexible Packaging Challenge
Plastic used for food and beverage packaging makes up two-thirds of the world’s plastic waste.  Rigid (non-flexible) food plastic packaging is partly recyclable.
However, flexible packaging (packages such as fresh produce, coffee, snacks, granola bars, etc.) is a growing segment of the world’s packaging market. Even though the volume of flexible packaging is smaller by weight and space, most flexible packaging cannot be practically recycled. Flexible packaging isn’t made of pure plastic polymers but rather made by blending several materials. These blended materials make flexible packaging complicated for separation and recycling.
We share our vision as an incentive to overcome this challenge with a growing community around the globe, including consumers and brands that strive for a circular economy approach, and wish that compostable packaging will become a day-to-day solution for both food and packaging waste.

5281,Agritecture,[1-10],www.agritecture.com,"Food & Agriculture, Food, Agriculture, & Land Use","Brooklyn, NY, USA","Agritecture is the art, science, and business of integrating agriculture into cities.
The term was first popularized by our Founder, Henry Gordon-Smith, in Fall 2011 when Henry was researching how cities could use agriculture to address environmental, social and economic challenges, and to develop resilient food systems in the face of climate change. By definition, Agritecture is about applying architectural thinking when designing agriculture for the built environment.

In practice, architects and urban farmers incorporate agriculture into the surrounding city environment in very different ways. Architects frequently design impossible vertical farming and urban agriculture concepts that ignore the realities of successful farming operations. In contrast, agriculturalists and entrepreneurs often miss important design, aesthetic, and social integration opportunities when they develop urban farms. Agritecture is about integrating the disciplines of agriculture and architecture so that urban farms can be both practical and well-designed all at once.

 Today, Agritecture’s blog covers a wide range of global and local urban agriculture news, including topics such as: greenhouse production, vertical farming, aquaponics, hydroponics, regenerative agriculture, ag-tech, and food systems more broadly. Agritecture’s consulting services are designed to help entrepreneurs, developers, and cities plan and launch successful agritecture, urban agriculture, vertical farming, and local food system projects.

A lot of people ask us “what is Agritecture”? To help you better understand what Agritecture is, we have curated a selection of projects and concepts below that illustrate the concept and successfully balance the art, science, and business of integrating agriculture into the built environment."

Triton is a highly efficient multi-mode point absorber that consists of a catenary moored surface float connected to an optimally-shaped, vertically asymmetric heave plate by three taut, flexible tethers. Unlike most conventional WECs, Triton’s surface float is excited by ocean waves in multiple modes – heave, pitch, surge and roll – allowing for increased energy capture across a wide range of ocean conditions enabling a substantially lower levelized cost of electricity.
Triton’s projected performance is based on extensive numerical modeling validated by tank testing at 1:50 scale. Testing of a 1:20 scale model is planned for Q3 2016.

HIGH EFFICIENCY ENERGY CAPTURE & CONVERSION
Triton’s drivetrain uses a variable linear hydraulic gearbox to amplify and transfer loads from the tethers to the generators. The gearbox is a high reliability hydrostatic system similar to that used in hydraulic presses. It delivers the benefits of a conventional rotary gearbox without complex moving parts. Specifically, it also allows for optimum matching of the wave-generated forces to the generator input forces, so that the generators operate at maximum efficiency while allowing the appropriate system compliance for coupling with the input wave.
Every WEC has an optimal force/displacement profile for maximum mechanical energy capture and efficiency in each wave condition. Triton’s linear gearbox design allows the load amplification factor to be adjusted to optimal levels during operation based on the wave state, enabling generator displacements to be maintained at an optimum level that is largely independent of the surface float’s displacement, maximizing power transfer over a wider range of sea states than other WECs.

The linear gearbox thus makes a significant contribution to the wide power bandwidth, increased reliability, and reduced cost. It also enables various non-continuous control strategies such as latching and declutching without imposing excess loadings on the generator or marine system, which may enable the use of advanced active control algorithms to boost power in lower sea states. Optimization of the linear drivetrain, including the linear gearbox, is being funded by Wave Energy Scotland."

NanoGraf Technologies has demonstrated a novel high energy density Si-based anode material that has the long-term potential to replace graphite based anodes in lithium-ion batteries for a range of applications, from consumer electronics to electric vehicles.

We patented a low cost manufacturing process already proven at the multi-ton scale.
NanoGraf’s proprietary manufacturing process is differentiated from competitors relying on expensive and complex vapor deposition-based systems. Instead, we utilize a wet chemistry process that is highly scalable and already proven in a multi ton-scale pilot manufacturing line in Japan.

Our anode materials drop in to existing electrode mixing and coating equipment, and they have been validated in large scale battery manufacturing facilities worldwide.

Our silicon-graphene anode materials enable longer lasting, faster charging batteries.
NanoGraf technology was developed, optimized, and patented by our team working in collaboration with researchers at Northwestern University and Argonne National Laboratory.

SiNode’s technology utilizes a proprietary silicon alloy-graphene material architecture to achieve category-leading performance and solutions to long-standing Si anode technical hurdles. The proprietary combination of silicon-based alloys and a flexible 3D graphene network helps stabilize the active material during charge and discharge.

Whereas current graphite-based anodes offer a capacity of 372 mAh/g, NanoGraf material can be customized to achieve capacities between 1000 mAh/g and over 2500 mAh/g, delivering higher cell level energy density and best-in-class rate capabilities for high discharge applications.

Current battery technology cannot meet the energy and power demands of today’s on-the-go consumer.
Over the past two decades lithium-ion batteries have become the primary technology powering the rapid growth of portable electronics and more recently electric vehicles. However, current battery chemistries have hit a plateau in performance improvements and are unable to meet consumer demand for ever increasing range, power, and cycling stability.

Founded in 2009, the Institute has trained over 14,000 farmers, ranchers, and pastoralists and influenced management of nearly 16 Million hectares of grasslands through the adoption of Holistic Planned Grazing – a process that mimics ancestral grazing patterns of wild herbivores that co-evolved with healthy grassland ecosystems. Developed by Allan Savory in the 1960’s, Holistic Management (HM) has been proven in a wide variety of contexts to regenerate grasslands, build soil, increase biodiversity, and sequester significant amounts of carbon while also improving social and economic outcomes.The Savory Global Network is comprised of regionally-based Savory Hubs (learning centers), Accredited Professionals (field educators), and Regenerating Members (recurring monthly donors) which together are our scale-up mechanism for increasing adoption. Savory Hubs are all locally owned and locally operated training centers that, through Accredited Professionals, provide HM training, resources, and implementation support to local farmers and ranchers. With an intimate knowledge of local culture, economy, policies, and environment, Hubs are able to mentor producers and help them implement these regenerative management practices in a contextually-specific manner that is relevant to their region.Savory’s Land to Market program, supported by the robust metrics of the Ecological Outcome Verification protocol, connects conscientious buyers, brands, and retailers directly to farms and ranches verified to be regenerating their land, creating the world’s first and only outcomes-based verified regenerative sourcing solution for the food and fiber industries. IMPACT TO DATEThe Savory Global Network currently operates across six continents training, equipping, and mentoring roughly 10 new Hubs per year. Since 2009, we have achieved the following impact:51 Global Hubs148 Accredited Professionals14,068 farmers/ranchers/pastoralists trained 15.9 million hectares of land holistically managedIn addition, Savory Institute periodically engages with municipalities, governments, and other NGO’s to collaborate on multi-year projects that build capacity within those organizations to scale the use of regenerative land management practices. Examples of special projects include joint efforts with Heifer International in Senegal, with The Nature Conservancy in Colorado, and with ADRA in Mongolia.Savory’s big audacious goal for 2025 is to influence management on 1 billion hectares of land and make a significant dent in carbon drawdown before it is too late. Through a growing global network and new programs in the pipeline to accelerate adoption, this goal is not just achievable, but necessary to create a livable planet for many generations to come."

The energy industry in Britain is ruled by a handful of complacent dinosaurs peddling fossil fuels, pricing trickery and poor customer service. In 2016, Octopus entered the market to disrupt the status quo with energy that's good for the planet, good for your wallet, and, honestly, good for your soul.
Since then, we've been picking up 30,000 customers a month on average, and now supply energy to 1.5 million UK homes (and counting). To this day, 92% of our customers rate us as 5* Excellent on TrustPilot; and we’re the only supplier to be recommended by consumer champion, Which? year after year after year..
Why?
We work for you
We do things differently. Our prices are fair and transparent, and we don't lock you into a contract, so you can leave at any time. In fact, we try to make everything as easy as possible for you, from the simplicity of our bills to offering customer service over email and social media at times that suit you — 8am‐10pm, 7 days a week.
The better choice, whether it's for your home, or your business
We provide an easy, affordable energy option for Great Britain's visionary businesses. Whether you're one of the world's biggest football clubs or selling magic wands in Brighton, we'll supply your business with power from the sun.
We work with amazing brands like Arsenal FC and Marks & Spencer, helping legendary UK institutions lead the charge on sustainability nationwide.
Renewable energy as standard
We want to make the eco‐friendly choice the easy choice, so all of our tariffs use 100% green electricity — and they're no more expensive than our competitors' non‐green tariffs. You can also carbon offset the gas you use if you want to minimise your environmental impact even further.
And we make sure today's renewables infrastructure keeps on turning, generating clean, green energy to power Great Britain. We're backed by Octopus Investments, the UK's largest investor in solar power, responsible for nearly 40% of the nation's large scale solar generation.
Energy fit for the future
While we look after your energy supply today, we're also building technology that will define the industry's future, from the big ideas to the small.
In 2017, we launched Octopus Tracker, a UK‐first tariff championing price transparency like never before, offering fair daily rates based on the wholesale price of energy.
Then, in 2018, we became the only supplier to really harness the potential of smart meter technology with Agile Octopus, a time of use tariff with half‐hourly rates allowing customers to adjust their consumption to times when the wholesale price of energy is cheapest.
Next came Octopus Go, a tariff designed just for EV drivers, with a super cheap night rate so these early adopters of the future of green transport can always wake up fully charged.
And it's not just about your home energy: Octopus Electric Vehicles is helping GB drivers switch to greener cars, providing everything from the car itself to smart charging options. We're getting our world ready for this electric revolution with Powerloop, an EV leasing bundle introducing vehicle‐to‐grid charging to GB homes. Drivers use their cars to power their homes during times of peak energy demand to relieve pressure on the grid.

Thought for Food




Here’s the deal: One-third of the world’s food goes to waste. Which means all the water, energy and greenhouse gases used to produce that food are wasted with it, making the food industry one of the biggest contributors to climate change.
This is an issue with a $990 billion price tag for the food industry and an even bigger one for the planet. And with the world population expected to grow to 10 billion people by mid-century, the costs will only increase. It’s an insanely complex problem, but we believe the solution is simple Economics 101: supply and demand.


 
What if we could eliminate waste by better balancing the supply and demand of food? 






On-demand delivery is changing the landscape for food brands, creating a massive opportunity: data. Zume uses real-time food consumption data and predictive analytics to help food companies better predict demand, connect it with production and drive better resource decisions down the food supply chain.
Our technology harnesses that data and gives it purpose by allowing any food company to tap into our infrastructure. We call it a sustainability fabric, because it weaves all the pieces of the food system together in a way that’s better for business and our planet.








Here’s how it works
 Zume Forward makes this data actionable, with mobile kitchens, connected appliances and predictive analytics that enable food brands to expand operations closer to customer demand and use resources more efficiently.

Zume Source brings data to the supply chain, creating smarter and more sustainable methods for how food is grown, produced and delivered, including 100% compostable fiber-molded packaging that, at scale, is more affordable than paper or plastic.
And Zume Culinary ensures that quality never suffers by elevating hospitality throughout the delivery experience with menu design, advanced commissary techniques and process automation.
Zume is creating a connected technology infrastructure across the entire food supply chain. We’re hopeful that, together with our partners, we can create better outcomes for businesses and a healthier planet in the process.

Target 6.3 – By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.

To help, Calix has developed ACTI-Mag Magnesium Hydroxide Mg(OH)2, a safe and more earth-friendly alternative to caustic soda for wastewater treatment across industries including municipalities, agriculture, and food manufacturing. It lets industries control pH and alkalinity in wastewater for odour control, and address significant issues such as phosphate or fats, oils, and greases.

WATERAID
Transforming lives through safe water, sanitation and hygiene education
Calix supports WaterAid programs to facilitate access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene in the world’s poorest and most marginalised communities.

This partnership with WaterAid aligns perfectly with our purpose and the reason why we exist, “We Solve Global Challenges” and with our core value of “positive impact”.

Improving the sustainability of water treatment
Calix is developing safe, sustainable solutions to prevent odour, protect existing and new infrastructure, and improve wastewater treatment performance.

SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy
ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SUSTAINABLE AND MODERN ENERGY FOR ALL.
To help, along with our work on bioenergy, Calix is developing high performance, low-cost, fast charge-discharge lithium-ion hybrid batteries based on nano-active electrode materials.

Target 7.2 – BY 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.

To help, Calix is developing high performance, affordable, and more recyclable lithium-ion hybrid batteries based on nano-active electrode materials produced by its new BATMn reactor in Australia.

In another approach to developing clean, affordable energy sources, Calix’s ACTI-Mag can be used in anaerobic digesters to help convert wastewater into energy while reducing struvite.

SDG 13: Climate action
TAKE URGENT ACTION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS.
To help, Calix’s technology is being developed and adapted to reduce CO2 emissions in cement, lime, and hydrogen production.

For example, Calix’s technology is being used to reduce CO2 emissions in cement, lime, and hydrogen production. For example, Calix is a key participant in LEILAC (Low Emissions Intensity Lime and Cement); a European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation project that will help Europe’s cement and lime industries reduce their CO2 emissions dramatically without significant energy or capital penalty.

Calix is the core technology provider and project leader.

Reducing emissions from the cement industry
Project leilac utilises the Calix Process – a world first patented technology that changes the way limestone is heated. Find out more.

SDG 14: Life below water
SDG 14 FOCUSES ON KEEPING OCEANS SAFE AND CLEAN.
To help, Calix is advancing shrimp and prawn aquaculture with an environmentally friendly water conditioning using AQUA-Cal+.

AQUA-Cal+ is also being developed for freshwater lake and pond remediation.

Aquaculture is seen as a viable way to meet the growing demand for animal products globally with more efficient feed use than cattle or pig farming. However, aquaculture feed and waste produce nitrogen and phosphorus, the build-up of these elements on water beds may lead to negative ecological disruptions. If uncontrolled, the spread of algae could lead to the deaths of many species, and affect the biodiversity of ecosystems.

AQUA-Cal+ is a safe, environmentally friendly source of alkalinity; an important requirement for pond water conditioning.

Its high reactivity and surface area are proven to help prevent the build-up of free ammonia and phosphate, which leads to blue-green algae runaways. AQUA-Cal+ is also formulated with high levels of calcium, an important element for crustacean exoskeletons and fish bone formation.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals
STRENGTHEN THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND REVITALIZE THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
Calix develops its technology via a global network of research and development collaborations, including governments, research institutes and universities, some of world’s largest companies, and a growing customer base and distributor network for its commercialised products and processes.

Calix is a key participant in LEILAC (Low Emissions Intensity Lime and Cement), a European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation project that will help Europe’s cement and lime industries reduce their CO2 emissions dramatically without significant energy or capital penalty.

142303,Forest Trends,[11-50],https://www.forest-trends.org/,"Advocacy or Policy, Carbon Accounting & Offsetting, Ecosystems & Biodiversity, Food, Agriculture, & Land Use","Washington D.C., DC, USA","The fate of our climate is intrinsically tied to the fate of our natural ecosystems. Earth’s forests soak up between 30 and 40 percent of global carbon emissions each year. Oceans absorb another quarter. In the United States, specifically, forests, grasslands, and soils already sequester more than half the amount of carbon that all cars and trucks on US roads emit.
Protecting these carbon-rich ecosystems isn’t optional; it’s a prerequisite for ensuring a habitable Earth for future generations.
We have a long way to go. Deforestation is responsible for around 15 percent of annual CO2 emissions around the world, reducing a significant portion of forests’ carbon storage. And the broader “land use” sector, which includes agriculture, is responsible for roughly 25 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.
While the challenge of cutting those numbers is daunting, the potential climate benefits are huge. Keeping trees standing prevents emissions from their destruction while at the same time bolstering the planet’s storage capacity for carbon, making forests a uniquely powerful weapon against climate change. For example, scientists estimate that halting and reversing tropical deforestation could carry us a quarter of the way toward avoiding catastrophic global warming.Forest Trends’ work on emissions cuts across traditional boundaries to find practical, real-world solutions by bringing new allies to the table. Specifically, we:

Track progress by governments and international institutions toward financing forest protection, particularly through the UN program Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+)
Leverage new combinations of funding – public and private, domestic and international – to scale up forest conservation and “climate-smart” agriculture.
Enlist the help of the private sector, the biggest missing link in the fight against climate change – and how to pay for it.
Promote policies that put natural infrastructure to work helping vulnerable communities adapt to the intensifying effects of a changing climate.

6321,Membrion,[1-10],membrion.com/,Materials & Manufacturing,"Seattle, WA, USA","Filtering Ions to Save the Planet
Membrion™  is at the forefront of some of the world’s most challenging problems: clean water, global electrification and human health. The emerging technologies designed to revolutionize these fields all depend on filtering charged molecules, called ions. The need for low cost/high performance ion filters has never been stronger or more urgent.



One only has to look at California to see the potential impact of ion filters on drinking and agricultural water supplies. With annual snowpack deletion and persistent drought fueled by climate change, California (and many other parts of the world) faces fresh water crisis. One of the most viable solutions to this challenge is to purify brackish water through electrodialysis. While the state has 38 times more brackish water than fresh water supplies, and while electrodialysis is less costly than older technologies like reverse osmosis, existing expensive and low performance ion filters have prevented electrodialysis from being widely adopted. Membrion’s low cost/high performance membranes will enable dramatically lower cost solutions to produce potable water for agriculture and urban usage, all while using less energy and creating less waste than existing solutions today.



Ion filters are also at the heart of the burgeoning urban mobility market which is moving towards low cost, electric-powered solutions that are available on-demand. Each of these new solutions, from the scooter to the bike to the car, rely on Li-ion or other batteries today, or fuel cells tomorrow. In both cases, the word will need efficient and effective ion filters to expand beyond the capacity of today’s solutions.



This need is not isolated to transportation. California is the 5th largest economy in the world and is moving to 100% renewable energy by 2045, and some of the world’s largest and most admired brands, including Google, Ikea, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Nike, GM and Lego among many others, have also committed to 100% renewable energy. Energy storage is key to that success and new low cost/high performance ion filters are the limiting factor for today’s generation of flow batteries, the most promising grid scale-storage solution.

It’s hard to believe that such small molecules have such a big impact on the world’s future, but they do. Our efforts to bring a unique ion filter to market can materially accelerate a variety of new technologies to improve the lives of humans today and protect the future health of our planet."

This regenerative agriculture practice is all about balance, and working to ensure that we never over-impact a single part of the ecosystem - it’s the future of farming. The way Emmer & Co. raises our slow-growing birds will leave the land better.

Freedom, not ""access.""
Most brands raise birds in barns with minimal or no outdoor areas, but Emmer & Co. chickens are truly 100% pasture raised. We don’t use any barns or permanent structures to grow our birds; only modular, open ended hoop houses that we move when we rotate our pastures. These are built with recycled materials, and allow our birds to live an entirely outdoor life with the freedom to run and freely forage - year-round.

Moving forward:
by going back to nature.
Emmer & Co.’s way of farming may be a new system, but it takes its cues from the original farmer: mother nature. We enrich the soil by rotating our pastures with a mix of animal and plant life, and each species contributes something unique. These natural processes layer together in a virtuous cycle that improves soil health."

Real estate is the single largest contributor to carbon emissions, with buildings and construction generating nearly 40% of global carbon emissions. As the wave of sustainability incentives and requirements sweep across the US and the world, buildings are going to be forced to decarbonize.
Cortex provides real estate portfolios with software that analyzes a building’s data and provides operational recommendations to operate the building more efficiently – using less energy and reducing carbon emissions. Last year we helped our clients save over 23,000 tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of taking over 13,000 cars off the road. Unlike competitors, Cortex requires no new sensors, and no equipment upgrades. On average, customers see an 11% annual reduction in CO2 emissions. We are serving clients in 10 markets, including Canada, and serve some of the biggest brands in the market, including Empire State Realty Trust and Silverstein Properties."
